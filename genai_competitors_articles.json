    "content": "ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\n\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit.\n\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\n\nBelow, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\n\nOpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children's use.\n\nElon Musk's AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.\n\nOpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI's presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.\n\nSince its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT's mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.\n\nDespite unveiling GPT-5 as a \"one-size-fits-all\" AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new \"Auto,\" \"Fast,\" and \"Thinking\" modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5's \"dumber\" behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous \"chart crime\" from the live presentation.\n\nOpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that's not just smarter but more useful -- able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs -- while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions.\n\nOpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.\n\nOpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nChatGPT's rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI's VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app's growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.\n\nOpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.\n\nChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren't bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.\n\nChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That's more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot's explosive growth.\n\nOpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user's calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.\n\nResearchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are \"being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,\" the study found \"significant risks.\"\n\nCEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.\n\nOpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet's Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.\n\nSome ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called \"Study Together\" appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot's approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.\n\nReferrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don't lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.\n\nOpenAI has started using Google's AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non-Nvidia chips in an important way.\n\nResearchers from MIT's Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb's X post.\n\nSam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.\n\nOpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.\n\nOpenAI upgraded ChatGPT's conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users' own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company's slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.\n\nOpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive's devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI's reach to a larger audience in the future.\n\nOpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and \"cleaner\" code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person's life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.\n\nOpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.\n\nOpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.\n\nAfter introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI's products.\n\nOpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI's products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company's expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.\n\nOpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.\n\nOpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on \"additional fixes\" to the model's personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.\n\nAn issue within OpenAI's ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch's testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. \"Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,\" a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \"In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.\"\n\nOpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.\n\nOpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI's cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI's VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step -- sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 -- claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that \"GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won't be a separate system card released for it.\"\n\nQuestions have been raised regarding OpenAI's transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI's top-reported score.\n\nOpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.\n\nOpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI's safety report.\n\nOpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI's previous models.\n\nOpen AI introduced a new section called \"library\" to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company's X post.\n\nOpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if \"another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.\" The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.\n\nOpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk's X and Mark Zuckerberg's Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI's API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.\n\nOpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model -- GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano -- with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It's accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's upgraded V3.\n\nOpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI's API.\n\nOpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.\n\nOpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\n\nIt looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new \"ImageGen\" watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: \"Structured Thoughts,\" \"Reasoning Recap,\" \"CoT Search Tool,\" and \"l1239dk1.\"\n\nOpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.\n\nMore than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.\n\nThe Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 \"reasoning\" model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\n\nIn a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. \"We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,\" he wrote.\n\nOpeanAI intends to release its \"first\" open language model since GPT-2 \"in the coming months.\" The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\n\nOpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now \"evolved\" its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.\n\nOpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.\n\nThe latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like \"My Neighbor Totoro\" and \"Spirited Away.\" The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\n\nOpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\n\nOpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\n\nBrad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\n\nOpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are \"more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,\" a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\n\nNoyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. \"The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,\" said Joakim S\u00f6derberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. \"If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.\"\n\nOpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, \"gpt-4o-mini-tts,\" that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called \"gpt-4o-transcribe\" and \"gpt-4o-mini-transcribe\". The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 \"reasoning\" AI model to deliver \"consistently better responses.\" It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nNoam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for \"reasoning\" could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a \"new model\" that's \"really good\" at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt \"Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.\" OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nOpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents -- automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks -- using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI intends to release several \"agent\" products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a \"high-income knowledge worker\" agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting \"PhD-level research,\" are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nThe latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nAccording to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.\n\nOpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a \"simplified\" product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that \"integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,\" including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nA commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nIn response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step \"thought\" process. ChatGPT users will see an updated \"chain of thought\" that shows more of the model's \"reasoning\" steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\n\nOpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI announced a new AI \"agent\" called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the \"agent\" is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nOpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launched a new AI \"reasoning\" model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both \"powerful\" and \"affordable.\"\n\nA new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI \"agent\" tool, for up to 90 days -- even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.\n\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\n\nOperator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.\n\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number -- no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and \"traits\" they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like \"Chatty,\" \"Encouraging,\" and \"Gen Z.\" However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nYes.\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nIt's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness -- in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \"certain jurisdictions\" (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \"in accordance with applicable laws\".\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \"OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\".\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \"legitimate interest\" (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out -- when it writes: \"See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\"\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data."

    "content": "ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\n\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit.\n\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\n\nBelow, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\n\nDespite unveiling GPT-5 as a \"one-size-fits-all\" AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new \"Auto,\" \"Fast,\" and \"Thinking\" modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5's \"dumber\" behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous \"chart crime\" from the live presentation.\n\nOpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that's not just smarter but more useful -- able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs -- while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions.\n\nOpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.\n\nOpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nChatGPT's rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI's VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app's growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.\n\nOpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.\n\nChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren't bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.\n\nChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That's more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot's explosive growth.\n\nOpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user's calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.\n\nResearchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are \"being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,\" the study found \"significant risks.\"\n\nCEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.\n\nOpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet's Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.\n\nSome ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called \"Study Together\" appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot's approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.\n\nReferrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don't lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.\n\nOpenAI has started using Google's AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non-Nvidia chips in an important way.\n\nResearchers from MIT's Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb's X post.\n\nSam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.\n\nOpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.\n\nOpenAI upgraded ChatGPT's conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users' own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company's slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.\n\nOpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive's devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI's reach to a larger audience in the future.\n\nOpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and \"cleaner\" code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person's life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.\n\nOpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.\n\nOpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.\n\nAfter introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI's products.\n\nOpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI's products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company's expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.\n\nOpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.\n\nOpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on \"additional fixes\" to the model's personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.\n\nAn issue within OpenAI's ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch's testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. \"Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,\" a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \"In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.\"\n\nOpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.\n\nOpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI's cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI's VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step -- sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 -- claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that \"GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won't be a separate system card released for it.\"\n\nQuestions have been raised regarding OpenAI's transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI's top-reported score.\n\nOpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.\n\nOpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI's safety report.\n\nOpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI's previous models.\n\nOpen AI introduced a new section called \"library\" to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company's X post.\n\nOpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if \"another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.\" The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.\n\nOpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk's X and Mark Zuckerberg's Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI's API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.\n\nOpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model -- GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano -- with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It's accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's upgraded V3.\n\nOpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI's API.\n\nOpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.\n\nOpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\n\nIt looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new \"ImageGen\" watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: \"Structured Thoughts,\" \"Reasoning Recap,\" \"CoT Search Tool,\" and \"l1239dk1.\"\n\nOpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.\n\nMore than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.\n\nThe Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 \"reasoning\" model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\n\nIn a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. \"We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,\" he wrote.\n\nOpeanAI intends to release its \"first\" open language model since GPT-2 \"in the coming months.\" The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\n\nOpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now \"evolved\" its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.\n\nOpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.\n\nThe latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like \"My Neighbor Totoro\" and \"Spirited Away.\" The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\n\nOpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\n\nOpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\n\nBrad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\n\nOpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are \"more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,\" a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\n\nNoyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. \"The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,\" said Joakim S\u00f6derberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. \"If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.\"\n\nOpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, \"gpt-4o-mini-tts,\" that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called \"gpt-4o-transcribe\" and \"gpt-4o-mini-transcribe\". The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 \"reasoning\" AI model to deliver \"consistently better responses.\" It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nNoam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for \"reasoning\" could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a \"new model\" that's \"really good\" at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt \"Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.\" OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nOpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents -- automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks -- using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI intends to release several \"agent\" products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a \"high-income knowledge worker\" agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting \"PhD-level research,\" are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nThe latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nAccording to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.\n\nOpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a \"simplified\" product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that \"integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,\" including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nA commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nIn response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step \"thought\" process. ChatGPT users will see an updated \"chain of thought\" that shows more of the model's \"reasoning\" steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\n\nOpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI announced a new AI \"agent\" called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the \"agent\" is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nOpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launched a new AI \"reasoning\" model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both \"powerful\" and \"affordable.\"\n\nA new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI \"agent\" tool, for up to 90 days -- even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.\n\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\n\nOperator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.\n\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number -- no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and \"traits\" they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like \"Chatty,\" \"Encouraging,\" and \"Gen Z.\" However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nYes.\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nIt's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness -- in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \"certain jurisdictions\" (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \"in accordance with applicable laws\".\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \"OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\".\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \"legitimate interest\" (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out -- when it writes: \"See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\"\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data."

    "content": "ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\n\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit.\n\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\n\nBelow, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\n\nOpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.\n\nChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren't bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.\n\nChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That's more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot's explosive growth.\n\nOpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user's calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.\n\nResearchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are \"being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,\" the study found \"significant risks.\"\n\nCEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.\n\nOpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet's Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.\n\nSome ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called \"Study Together\" appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot's approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.\n\nReferrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don't lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.\n\nOpenAI has started using Google's AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non-Nvidia chips in an important way.\n\nResearchers from MIT's Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb's X post.\n\nSam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.\n\nOpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.\n\nOpenAI upgraded ChatGPT's conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users' own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company's slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.\n\nOpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive's devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI's reach to a larger audience in the future.\n\nOpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and \"cleaner\" code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person's life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.\n\nOpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.\n\nOpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.\n\nAfter introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI's products.\n\nOpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI's products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company's expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.\n\nOpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.\n\nOpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on \"additional fixes\" to the model's personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.\n\nAn issue within OpenAI's ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch's testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. \"Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,\" a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \"In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.\"\n\nOpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.\n\nOpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI's cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI's VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step -- sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 -- claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that \"GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won't be a separate system card released for it.\"\n\nQuestions have been raised regarding OpenAI's transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI's top-reported score.\n\nOpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.\n\nOpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI's safety report.\n\nOpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI's previous models.\n\nOpen AI introduced a new section called \"library\" to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company's X post.\n\nOpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if \"another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.\" The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.\n\nOpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk's X and Mark Zuckerberg's Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI's API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.\n\nOpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model -- GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano -- with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It's accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's upgraded V3.\n\nOpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI's API.\n\nOpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.\n\nOpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\n\nIt looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new \"ImageGen\" watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: \"Structured Thoughts,\" \"Reasoning Recap,\" \"CoT Search Tool,\" and \"l1239dk1.\"\n\nOpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.\n\nMore than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.\n\nThe Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 \"reasoning\" model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\n\nIn a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. \"We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,\" he wrote.\n\nOpeanAI intends to release its \"first\" open language model since GPT-2 \"in the coming months.\" The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\n\nOpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now \"evolved\" its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.\n\nOpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.\n\nThe latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like \"My Neighbor Totoro\" and \"Spirited Away.\" The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\n\nOpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\n\nOpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\n\nBrad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\n\nOpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are \"more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,\" a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\n\nNoyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. \"The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,\" said Joakim S\u00f6derberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. \"If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.\"\n\nOpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, \"gpt-4o-mini-tts,\" that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called \"gpt-4o-transcribe\" and \"gpt-4o-mini-transcribe\". The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 \"reasoning\" AI model to deliver \"consistently better responses.\" It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nNoam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for \"reasoning\" could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a \"new model\" that's \"really good\" at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt \"Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.\" OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nOpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents -- automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks -- using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI intends to release several \"agent\" products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a \"high-income knowledge worker\" agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting \"PhD-level research,\" are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nThe latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nAccording to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.\n\nOpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a \"simplified\" product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that \"integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,\" including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nA commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nIn response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step \"thought\" process. ChatGPT users will see an updated \"chain of thought\" that shows more of the model's \"reasoning\" steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\n\nOpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI announced a new AI \"agent\" called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the \"agent\" is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nOpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launched a new AI \"reasoning\" model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both \"powerful\" and \"affordable.\"\n\nA new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI \"agent\" tool, for up to 90 days -- even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.\n\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\n\nOperator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.\n\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number -- no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and \"traits\" they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like \"Chatty,\" \"Encouraging,\" and \"Gen Z.\" However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nYes.\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nIt's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness -- in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \"certain jurisdictions\" (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \"in accordance with applicable laws\".\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \"OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\".\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \"legitimate interest\" (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out -- when it writes: \"See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\"\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data."

    "content": "Much attention was paid to OpenAI's Sam Altman and xAI's Elon Musk trading barbs on X this week after Musk threatened to sue Apple over supposedly biased App Store rankings privileging ChatGPT over Grok.\n\nBut while the heated social media exchanges were among the most tense ever seen between the two former partners who cofounded OpenAI -- more on that below -- it seems likely that their jabs were motivated less by who's in the lead on Apple's \"Must Have\" app list than by an impending order in a lawsuit that landed in the middle of their public beefing.\n\nYesterday, a court ruled that OpenAI can proceed with claims that Musk was so incredibly stung by OpenAI's success after his exit didn't doom the nascent AI company that he perpetrated a \"years-long harassment campaign\" to take down OpenAI.\n\nMusk's motivation? To clear the field for xAI to dominate the AI industry instead, OpenAI alleged.\n\nOpenAI's accusations arose as counterclaims in a lawsuit that Musk initially filed in 2024. Musk has alleged that Altman and OpenAI had made a \"fool\" of Musk, goading him into $44 million in donations by \"preying on Musk's humanitarian concern about the existential dangers posed by artificial intelligence.\"\n\nBut OpenAI insists that Musk's lawsuit is just one prong in a sprawling, \"unlawful,\" and \"unrelenting\" harassment campaign that Musk waged to harm OpenAI's business by forcing the company to divert resources or expend money on things like withdrawn legal claims and fake buyouts.\n\n\"Musk could not tolerate seeing such success for an enterprise he had abandoned and declared doomed,\" OpenAI argued. \"He made it his project to take down OpenAI, and to build a direct competitor that would seize the technological lead -- not for humanity but for Elon Musk.\"\n\nMost significantly, OpenAI alleged that Musk forced OpenAI to entertain a \"sham\" bid to buy the company in February. Musk then shared details of the bid with The Wall Street Journal to artificially raise the price of OpenAI and potentially spook investors, OpenAI alleged. The company further said that Musk never intended to buy OpenAI and is willing to go to great lengths to mislead the public about OpenAI's business so he can chip away at OpenAI's head start in releasing popular generative AI products.\n\n\"Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,\" Altman's company said.\n\nTo this day, Musk maintains that Altman pretended that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit serving the public good in order to seize access to Musk's money and professional connections in its first five years and gain a lead in AI. As Musk sees it, Altman always intended to \"betray\" these promises in pursuit of personal gains, and Musk is hoping a court will return any ill-gotten gains to Musk and xAI.\n\nIn a small win for Musk, the court ruled that OpenAI will have to wait until the first phase of the trial litigating Musk's claims concludes before the court will weigh OpenAI's theories on Musk's alleged harassment campaign. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers noted that all of OpenAI's counterclaims occurred after the period in which Musk's claims about a supposed breach of contract occurred, necessitating a division of the lawsuit into two parts. Currently, the jury trial is scheduled for March 30, 2026, presumably after which, OpenAI's claims can be resolved.\n\nIf yesterday's X clash between the billionaires is any indication, it seems likely that tensions between Altman and Musk will only grow as discovery and expert testimony on Musk's claims proceed through December.\n\nWhether OpenAI will prevail on its counterclaims is anybody's guess. Gonzalez Rogers noted that Musk and OpenAI have been hypocritical in arguments raised so far, condemning the \"gamesmanship of both sides\" as \"obvious, as each flip flops.\" However, \"for the purposes of pleading an unfair or fraudulent business practice, it is sufficient [for OpenAI] to allege that the bid was a sham and designed to mislead,\" Gonzalez Rogers said, since OpenAI has alleged the sham bid \"ultimately did\" harm its business.\n\nIn April, OpenAI told the court that the AI company risks \"future irreparable harm\" if Musk's alleged campaign continues. Fast-forward to now, and Musk's legal threat to OpenAI's partnership with Apple seems to be the next possible front Musk may be exploring to allegedly harass Altman and intimidate OpenAI.\n\n\"With every month that has passed, Musk has intensified and expanded the fronts of his campaign against OpenAI,\" OpenAI argued. Musk \"has proven himself willing to take ever more dramatic steps to seek a competitive advantage for xAI and to harm Altman, whom, in the words of the President of the United States, Musk 'hates.'\"\n\nTensions escalate as Musk brands Altman a \"liar\"\n\nOn Monday evening, Musk threatened to sue Apple for supposedly favoring ChatGPT in App Store rankings, which he claimed was \"an unequivocal antitrust violation.\"\n\nSeemingly defending Apple later that night, Altman called Musk's claim \"remarkable,\" claiming he's heard allegations that Musk manipulates \"X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like.\"\n\nAt 4 am on Tuesday, Musk appeared to lose his cool, firing back a post that sought to exonerate the X owner of any claims that he tweaks his social platform to favor his own posts.\n\n\"You got 3M views on your bullshit post, you liar, far more than I've received on many of mine, despite me having 50 times your follower count!\" Musk responded.\n\nAltman apparently woke up ready to keep the fight going, suggesting that his post got more views as a fluke. He mocked X as running into a \"skill issue\" or \"bots\" messing with Musk's alleged agenda to boost his posts above everyone else. Then, in what may be the most explosive response to Musk yet, Altman dared Musk to double down on his defense, asking, \"Will you sign an affidavit that you have never directed changes to the X algorithm in a way that has hurt your competitors or helped your own companies? I will apologize if so.\"\n\nCourt filings from each man's legal team show how fast their friendship collapsed. But even as Musk's alleged harassment campaign started taking shape, their social media interactions show that underlying the legal battles and AI ego wars, the tech billionaires are seemingly hiding profound respect for -- and perhaps jealousy of -- each other's accomplishments.\n\nA brief history of Musk and Altman's feud\n\nMusk and Altman's friendship started over dinner in July 2015. That's when Musk agreed to help launch \"an AGI project that could become and stay competitive with DeepMind, an AI company under the umbrella of Google,\" OpenAI's filing said. At that time, Musk feared that a private company like Google would never be motivated to build AI to serve the public good.\n\nThe first clash between Musk and Altman happened six months later. Altman wanted OpenAI to be formed as a nonprofit, but Musk thought that was not \"optimal,\" OpenAI's filing said. Ultimately, Musk was overruled, and he joined the nonprofit as a \"member\" while also becoming co-chair of OpenAI's board.\n\nBut perhaps the first major disagreement, as Musk tells it, came in 2016, when Altman and Microsoft struck a deal to sell compute to OpenAI at a \"steep discount\" -- \"so long as the non-profit agreed to publicly promote Microsoft's products.\" Musk rejected the \"marketing ploy,\" telling Altman that \"this actually made me feel nauseous.\"\n\nNext, OpenAI claimed that Musk had a \"different idea\" in 2017 when OpenAI \"began considering an organizational change that would allow supporters not just to donate, but to invest.\" Musk wanted \"sole control of the new for-profit,\" OpenAI alleged, and he wanted to be CEO. The other founders, including Altman, \"refused to accept\" an \"AGI dictatorship\" that was \"dominated by Musk.\"\n\n\"Musk was incensed,\" OpenAI said, threatening to leave OpenAI over the disagreement, \"or I'm just being a fool who is essentially providing free funding for you to create a startup.\"\n\nBut Musk floated one more idea between 2017 and 2018 before severing ties -- offering to sell OpenAI to Tesla so that OpenAI could use Tesla as a \"cash cow.\" But Altman and the other founders still weren't comfortable with Musk controlling OpenAI, rejecting the idea and prompting Musk's exit.\n\nIn his filing, Musk tells the story a little differently, however. He claimed that he only \"briefly toyed with the idea of using Tesla as OpenAI's 'cash cow'\" after Altman and others pressured him to agree to a for-profit restructuring. According to Musk, among the last straws was a series of \"get-rich-quick schemes\" that Altman proposed to raise funding, including pushing a strategy where OpenAI would launch a cryptocurrency that Musk worried threatened the AI company's credibility.\n\nWhen Musk left OpenAI, it was \"noisy but relatively amicable,\" OpenAI claimed. But Musk continued to express discomfort from afar, still donating to OpenAI as Altman grabbed the CEO title in 2019 and created a capped-profit entity that Musk seemed to view as shady.\n\n\"Musk asked Altman to make clear to others that he had 'no financial interest in the for-profit arm of OpenAI,'\" OpenAI noted, and Musk confirmed he issued the demand \"with evident displeasure.\"\n\nAlthough they often disagreed, Altman and Musk continued to publicly play nice on Twitter (the platform now known as X), casually chatting for years about things like movies, space, and science, including repeatedly joking about Musk's posts about using drugs like Ambien.\n\nBy 2019, it seemed like none of these disagreements had seriously disrupted the friendship. For example, at that time, Altman defended Musk against people rooting against Tesla's success, writing that \"betting against Elon is historically a mistake\" and seemingly hyping Tesla by noting that \"the best product usually wins.\"\n\nThe niceties continued into 2021, when Musk publicly praised \"nice work by OpenAI\" integrating its coding model into GitHub's AI tool. \"It is hard to do useful things,\" Musk said, drawing a salute emoji from Altman.\n\nThis was seemingly the end of Musk playing nice with OpenAI, though. Soon after ChatGPT's release in November 2022, Musk allegedly began his attacks, seemingly willing to change his tactics on a whim.\n\nFirst, he allegedly deemed OpenAI \"irrelevant,\" predicting it would \"obviously\" fail. Then, he started sounding alarms, joining a push for a six-month pause on generative AI development. Musk specifically claimed that any model \"more advanced than OpenAI's just-released GPT-4\" posed \"profound risks to society and humanity,\" OpenAI alleged, seemingly angling to pause OpenAI's development in particular.\n\nHowever, in the meantime, Musk started \"quietly building a competitor,\" xAI, without announcing those efforts in March 2023, OpenAI alleged. Allegedly preparing to hobble OpenAI's business after failing with the moratorium push, Musk had his personal lawyer contact OpenAI and demand \"access to OpenAI's confidential and commercially sensitive internal documents.\"\n\nMusk claimed the request was to \"ensure OpenAI was not being taken advantage of or corrupted by Microsoft,\" but two weeks later, he appeared on national TV, insinuating that OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft was \"improper,\" OpenAI alleged.\n\nEventually, Musk announced xAI in July 2023, and that supposedly motivated Musk to deepen his harassment campaign, \"this time using the courts and a parallel, carefully coordinated media campaign,\" OpenAI said, as well as his own social media platform.\n\nMusk \"supercharges\" X attacks\n\nAs OpenAI's success mounted, the company alleged that Musk began specifically escalating his social media attacks on X, including broadcasting to his 224 million followers that \"OpenAI is a house of cards\" after filing his 2024 lawsuit.\n\nClaiming he felt conned, Musk also pressured regulators to probe OpenAI, encouraging attorneys general of California and Delaware to \"force\" OpenAI, \"without legal basis, to auction off its assets for the benefit of Musk and his associates,\" OpenAI said.\n\nBy 2024, Musk had \"supercharged\" his X attacks, unleashing a \"barrage of invective against the enterprise and its leadership, variously describing OpenAI as a 'digital Frankenstein's monster,' 'a lie,' 'evil,' and 'a total scam,'\" OpenAI alleged.\n\nThese attacks allegedly culminated in Musk's seemingly fake OpenAI takeover attempt in 2025, which OpenAI claimed a Musk ally, Ron Baron, admitted on CNBC was \"pitched to him\" as not an attempt to actually buy OpenAI's assets, \"but instead to obtain 'discovery' and get 'behind the wall' at OpenAI.\"\n\nAll of this makes it harder for OpenAI to achieve the mission that Musk is supposedly suing to defend, OpenAI claimed. They told the court that \"OpenAI has borne costs, and been harmed, by Musk's abusive tactics and unrelenting efforts to mislead the public for his own benefit and to OpenAI's detriment and the detriment of its mission.\"\n\nBut Musk argues that it's Altman who always wanted sole control over OpenAI, accusing his former partner of rampant self-dealing and \"locking down the non-profit's technology for personal gain\" as soon as \"OpenAI reached the threshold of commercially viable AI.\" He further claimed OpenAI blocked xAI funding by reportedly asking investors to avoid backing rival startups like Anthropic or xAI.\n\nMusk alleged:\n\nAltman alone stands to make billions from the non-profit Musk co-founded and invested considerable money, time, recruiting efforts, and goodwill in furtherance of its stated mission. Altman's scheme has now become clear: lure Musk with phony philanthropy; exploit his money, stature, and contacts to secure world-class AI scientists to develop leading technology; then feed the non-profit's lucrative assets into an opaque profit engine and proceed to cash in as OpenAI and Microsoft monopolize the generative AI market.\n\nFor Altman, this week's flare-up, where he finally took a hard jab back at Musk on X, may be a sign that Altman is done letting Musk control the narrative on X after years of somewhat tepidly pushing back on Musk's more aggressive posts.\n\nIn 2022, for example, Musk warned after ChatGPT's release that the chatbot was \"scary good,\" warning that \"we are not far from dangerously strong AI.\" Altman responded, cautiously agreeing that OpenAI was \"dangerously\" close to \"strong AI in the sense of an AI that poses e.g. a huge cybersecurity risk\" but \"real\" artificial general intelligence still seemed at least a decade off.\n\nAnd Altman gave no response when Musk used Grok's jokey programming to mock GPT-4 as \"GPT-Snore\" in 2024.\n\nHowever, Altman seemingly got his back up after Musk mocked OpenAI's $500 billion Stargate Project, which launched with the US government in January of this year. On X, Musk claimed that OpenAI doesn't \"actually have the money\" for the project, which Altman said was \"wrong,\" while mockingly inviting Musk to visit the worksite.\n\n\"This is great for the country,\" Altman said, retorting, \"I realize what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies, but in your new role [at the Department of Government Efficiency], I hope you'll mostly put [America] first.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Altman wants to keep trading jabs with Musk, who is generally a huge fan of trolling on X. But Altman seems more emboldened this week than he was back in January before Musk's breakup with Donald Trump. Back then, even when he was willing to push back on Musk's Stargate criticism by insulting Musk's politics, he still took the time to let Musk know that he still cares.\n\n\"I genuinely respect your accomplishments and think you are the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time,\" Altman told Musk in January."

    "content": "The original research paper describing GPT was published in 2018, with GPT-2 announced in 2019 and GPT-3 in 2020. These models are trained on huge datasets of text, much of it scraped from the internet, which is mined for statistical patterns. It's a relatively simple mechanism to describe, but the end result is flexible systems that can generate, summarize, and rephrase writing, as well as perform other text-based tasks like translation or generating code.\n\nOpenAI has partnered with another news publisher in Europe, London's Financial Times, that the company will be paying for content access. \"Through the partnership, ChatGPT users will be able to see select attributed summaries, quotes and rich links to FT journalism in response to relevant queries,\" the FT wrote in a press release. In a new peek behind the curtain of its AI's secret instructions, OpenAI also released a new NSFW policy. Though it's intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about whether OpenAI -- or any generative AI vendor -- can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically. ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in November, immediately went viral and had 1 million users in just its first five days because of the sophisticated way it generates in-depth, human-like prose responses to queries. By February, ChatGPT boasted 13 million unique daily users on average.\n\nWhereas the current generation GPT-3.5, which powers OpenAI's wildly popular ChatGPT conversational bot, can only read and respond with text, the new and improved GPT-4 will be able to generate text on input images as well. \"While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios,\" the OpenAI team wrote Tuesday, it \"exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.\" But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it's usually acceptable. [...] It's also a way to understand the \"hallucinations\", or nonsensical answers to factual questions, to which large language models such as ChatGPT are all too prone. These hallucinations are compression artifacts, but [...] they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals, which in this case means either the Web or our knowledge of the world.\n\nGPT-4 is OpenAI's language model, much more advanced than its predecessor, GPT-3.5. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 in a series of simulated benchmark exams and produces fewer hallucinations. Instead of asking for clarification on ambiguous questions, the model guesses what your question means, which can lead to poor responses. Generative AI models are also subject to hallucinations, which can result in inaccurate responses. SearchGPT is an experimental offering from OpenAI that functions as an AI-powered search engine that is aware of current events and uses real-time information from the Internet. The experience is a prototype, and OpenAI plans to integrate the best features directly into ChatGPT in the future.\n\nThis comes as a part of OpenAI's public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a \"democratic process\" for determining the rules AI systems follow. OpenAI announced a partnership with Reddit that will give the company access to \"real-time, structured and unique content\" from the social network. Content from Reddit will be incorporated into ChatGPT, and the companies will work together to bring new AI-powered features to Reddit users and moderators. ChatGPT's use of a transformer model (the \"T\" in ChatGPT) makes it a good tool for keyword research. It can generate related terms based on context and associations, compared to the more linear approach of more traditional keyword research tools.\n\nThis includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \"in accordance with applicable laws\". OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. In an email, OpenAI detailed an incoming update to its terms, including changing the OpenAI entity providing services to EEA and Swiss residents to OpenAI Ireland Limited.\n\nApple announced at WWDC 2024 that it is bringing ChatGPT to Siri and other first-party apps and capabilities across its operating systems. The ChatGPT integrations, powered by GPT-4o, will arrive on iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year, and will be free without the need to create a ChatGPT or OpenAI account. Features exclusive to paying ChatGPT users will also be available through Apple devices. OpenAI and TIME announced a multi-year strategic partnership that brings the magazine's content, both modern and archival, to ChatGPT. As part of the deal, TIME will also gain access to OpenAI's technology in order to develop new audience-based products.\n\nThe exact contents of X's (now permanent) undertaking with the DPC have not been made public, but it's assumed the agreement limits how it can use people's data. An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. OpenAI has said that individuals in \"certain jurisdictions\" (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form.\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus. New York-based law firm Cuddy Law was criticized by a judge for using ChatGPT to calculate their hourly billing rate. The firm submitted a $113,500 bill to the court, which was then halved by District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who called the figure \"well above\" reasonable demands. As part of a new partnership with OpenAI, the Dublin City Council will use GPT-4 to craft personalized itineraries for travelers, including recommendations of unique and cultural destinations, in an effort to support tourism across Europe. A new report from The Information, based on undisclosed financial information, claims OpenAI could lose up to $5 billion due to how costly the business is to operate.\n\nSince there is no guarantee that ChatGPT's outputs are entirely original, the chatbot may regurgitate someone else's work in your answer, which is considered plagiarism. OpenAI will, by default, use your conversations with the free chatbot to train data and refine its models. You can opt out of it using your data for model training by clicking on the question mark in the bottom left-hand corner, Settings, and turning off \"Improve the model for everyone.\" If your main concern is privacy, OpenAI has implemented several options to give users peace of mind that their data will not be used to train models. If you are concerned about the moral and ethical problems, those are still being hotly debated. ZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping.\n\nThe generative AI tool can answer questions and assist you with composing text, code, and much more. As predicted, the wider availability of these AI language models has created problems and challenges. But, some experts have argued that the harmful effects have still been less than anticipated. The company claims the model is \"more creative and collaborative than ever before\" and \"can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy.\" It can parse both text and image input, though it can only respond via text. OpenAI also cautions that the systems retain many of the same problems as earlier language models, including a tendency to make up information (or \"hallucinate\") and the capacity to generate violent and harmful text. OpenAI launched a paid subscription version called ChatGPT Plus in February 2023, which guarantees users access to the company's latest models, exclusive features, and updates.\n\nThe alpha version is now available to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users, and the company says the feature will gradually roll out to all Plus users in the fall of 2024. The release follows controversy surrounding the voice's similarity to Scarlett Johansson, leading OpenAI to delay its release. GPT-4, the latest incarnation of the artificial-intelligence (AI) system that powers ChatGPT, has stunned people with its ability to generate human-like text and images from almost any prompt. Researchers say this type of AI might change science similarly to how the Internet has changed it. Yet many people are frustrated that the model's underlying engineering is cloaked in secrecy. Assurances about GPT-4's improved safety by its creator OpenAI fall short for some.\n\nChatGPT offers many functions in addition to answering simple questions. ChatGPT can compose essays, have philosophical conversations, do math, and even code for you. Microsoft had already presented a multi-modal language model that operates in different formats called Kosmos-1.\n\nIf you want the best of both worlds, plenty of AI search engines combine both. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI thanks to multiyear, multi-billion dollar investments. Elon Musk was an investor when OpenAI was first founded in 2015 but has since completely severed ties with the startup and created his own AI chatbot, Grok. OpenAI has also developed DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3, popular AI image generators, and Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system. With a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, you can access GPT-4, GPT-4o mini or GPT-4o.\n\nYou can foun additiona information about ai customer service and artificial intelligence and NLP. The ChatGPT model can also challenge incorrect premises, answer follow-up questions, and even admit mistakes when you point them out. The AI assistant can identify inappropriate submissions to prevent unsafe content generation. Upon launching the prototype, users were given a waitlist to sign up for. If you are looking for a platform that can explain complex topics in an easy-to-understand manner, then ChatGPT might be what you want.\n\nThe company says these improvements will be added to GPT-4o in the coming weeks. On the The TED AI Show podcast, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner revealed that the board did not know about ChatGPT until its launch in November 2022. Toner also said that Sam Altman gave the board inaccurate information about the safety processes the company had in place and that he didn't disclose his involvement in the OpenAI Startup Fund. OpenAI has banned a cluster of ChatGPT accounts linked to an Iranian influence operation that was generating content about the U.S. presidential election. OpenAI identified five website fronts presenting as both progressive and conservative news outlets that used ChatGPT to draft several long-form articles, though it doesn't seem that it reached much of an audience. Here's a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year.\n\nYou would receive a $50 gift card, which can also be donated to charity. \"The difference comes out when the complexity of the task reaches a sufficient threshold. GPT-4 is more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5,\" the company said in its blog post today. Chatbot technology requires users to have a critical eye \"toward everything we see from it, and treat everything that comes out of this AI technology as a good first draft, right now,\" Diasio said in an earlier interview with Computerworld. The other capability OpenAI appears to be touting is the ability of GPT-4 to handle inputs in several languages beyond English. \"There we will have multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities,\" Braun said, according to the German news site Heise.\n\nThe temporary prototype is currently only available to a small group of users and its publisher partners, like The Atlantic, for testing and feedback. OpenAI has built a watermarking tool that could potentially catch students who cheat by using ChatGPT -- but The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is debating whether to actually release it. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is researching tools that can detect writing from ChatGPT, but said it's taking a \"deliberate approach\" to releasing it. OpenAI is facing internal drama, including the sizable exit of co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever as the company dissolved its Superalignment team.\n\nBut the feature falls short as an effective replacement for virtual assistants. And, though it may seem it from its human-like responses, ChatGPT isn't sentient -- it's a next-word prediction engine, according Dan Diasio, Ernst & Young global artificial intelligence consulting leader. It's been a long journey to get to GPT-4, with OpenAI -- and AI language models in general -- building momentum slowly over several years before rocketing into the mainstream in recent months. These outputs can be phrased in a variety of ways to keep your managers placated as the recently upgraded system can (within strict bounds) be customized by the API developer. The added multi-modal input feature will generate text outputs -- whether that's natural language, programming code, or what have you -- based on a wide variety of mixed text and image inputs. Microsoft was an early investor in OpenAI, the AI startup behind ChatGPT, long before ChatGPT was released to the public.\n\nThe AI tech will be used to help employees with work-related tasks and come as part of Match's $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024. According to Reuters, OpenAI's Sam Altman hosted hundreds of executives from Fortune 500 companies across several cities in April, pitching versions of its AI services intended for corporate use. OpenAI is opening a new office in Tokyo and has plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language. The move underscores how OpenAI will likely need to localize its technology to different languages as it expands. OpenAI announced new updates for easier data analysis within ChatGPT. Users can now upload files directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, interact with tables and charts, and export customized charts for presentations.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot offers free image generation, also powered by DALL-E 3, in its chatbot. This is a great alternative if you don't want to pay for ChatGPT Plus but want high-quality image outputs. Since OpenAI discontinued DALL-E 2 in February 2024, the only way to access its most advanced AI image generator, DALL-E 3, through OpenAI's offerings is via its chatbot. People have expressed concerns about AI chatbots replacing or atrophying human intelligence.\n\nHowever, on March 19, 2024, OpenAI stopped letting users install new plugins or start new conversations with existing ones. Instead, OpenAI replaced plugins with GPTs, which are easier for developers to build. Despite ChatGPT's extensive abilities, other chatbots have advantages that might be better suited for your use case, including Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, Jasper, and more.\n\nLastly, there are ethical and privacy concerns regarding the information ChatGPT was trained on. OpenAI scraped the internet to train the chatbot without asking content owners for permission to use their content, which brings up many copyright and intellectual property concerns. Our goal is to deliver the most accurate information and the most knowledgeable advice possible in order to help you make smarter buying decisions on tech gear and a wide array of products and services.\n\nThe Atlantic and Vox Media have announced licensing and product partnerships with OpenAI. Both agreements allow OpenAI to use the publishers' current content to generate responses in ChatGPT, which will feature citations to relevant articles. Vox Media says it will use OpenAI's technology to build \"audience-facing and internal applications,\" while The Atlantic will build a new experimental product called Atlantic Labs. OpenAI is giving users their first access to GPT-4o's updated realistic audio responses.\n\nThe launch of GPT-4o has driven the company's biggest-ever spike in revenue on mobile, despite the model being freely available on the web. Mobile users are being pushed to upgrade to its $19.99 monthly subscription, ChatGPT Plus, if they want to experiment with OpenAI's most recent launch. OpenAI planned to start rolling out its advanced Voice Mode feature to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users in late June, but it says lingering issues forced it to postpone the launch to July.\n\nA Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI's VP of consumer product dodged a question on whether artists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists \"opt out\" of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous. TechCrunch found that the OpenAI's GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs.\n\nThe cells were injected into mouse brains, and, six months later, the researchers analysed the cellular identities that the cells' progeny had taken. The hope is that this study, and others like it, will illuminate how cell development goes awry in neurological diseases. The newer version of ChatGPT's large language model should help address the issue, but won't likely solve it, according to Gartner's Chandrasekaran. We found and fixed some bugs and improved our theoretical foundations. As a result, our GPT-4 training run was...unprecedentedly stable, becoming our first large model whose training performance we were able to accurately predict ahead of time,\" OpenAI said. The rumor mill was further energized last week after a Microsoft executive let slip that the system would launch this week in an interview with the German press.\n\nFurthermore, it provided false positives 9% of the time, incorrectly identifying human-written work as AI-produced. AI models can generate advanced, realistic content that can be exploited by bad actors for harm, such as spreading misinformation about public figures and influencing elections. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help users find information.\n\nA great way to get started is by asking a question, similar to what you would do with Google. When you click through from our site to a retailer and buy a product or service, we may earn affiliate commissions. This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay.\n\nPlus, users also have priority access to GPT-4o, even at capacity, while free users get booted down to GPT-4o mini. If your application has any written supplements, you can use ChatGPT to help you write those essays or personal statements. You can also use ChatGPT to prep for your interviews by asking ChatGPT to provide you mock interview questions, background on the company, or questions that you can ask. Yes, an official ChatGPT app is available for iPhone and Android users. Make sure to download OpenAI's app, as many copycat fake apps are listed on Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store that are not affiliated with OpenAI. Creating an OpenAI account still offers some perks, such as saving and reviewing your chat history, accessing custom instructions, and, most importantly, getting free access to GPT-4o.\n\nFor example, chatbots can write an entire essay in seconds, raising concerns about students cheating and not learning how to write properly. These fears even led some school districts to block access when ChatGPT initially https://chat.openai.com/ launched. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code.\n\nSpeculation about GPT-4 and its capabilities have been rife over the past year, with many suggesting it would be a huge leap over previous systems. However, judging from OpenAI's announcement, the improvement is more iterative, as the company previously warned. The company says GPT-4's improvements are evident in the system's performance on a number of tests and benchmarks, including the Uniform Bar Exam, LSAT, SAT Math, and SAT Evidence-Based Reading & Writing exams. In the exams mentioned, GPT-4 scored in the 88th percentile and above, and a full list of exams and the system's scores can be seen here.\n\nThe work shows how OR51E2 'recognizes' the cheesy smelling propionate molecule through specific molecular interactions that switch the receptor on. Mutations affecting one of the amino acids in a region of the receptor called the binding pocket thwart the interactions. The study is a step towards scientists' goal of building a molecular atlas of olfactory receptors and the odours they recognize. ai chat gpt 4 On July 18, 2024, OpenAI released GPT-4o mini, a smaller version of GPT-4o replacing GPT-3.5 Turbo on the ChatGPT interface. Its API costs $0.15 per million input tokens and $0.60 per million output tokens, compared to $5 and $15 respectively for GPT-4o. Training data also suffers from algorithmic bias, which may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts including descriptors of people.\n\nIn a new \"red teaming\" report, OpenAI reveals some of GPT-4o's weirder quirks, like mimicking the voice of the person speaking to it or randomly shouting in the middle of a conversation. Scientists have followed the developmental destiny of individual human brain cells as they progress from stem cells to specialized structures in the brain. In a technical \"tour de force\", the team painstakingly purified and classified undifferentiated brain cells from human fetuses.\n\nIn addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,\" a spokesperson said. Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Denver Post, are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The lawsuit alleges that the companies stole millions of copyrighted articles \"without permission and without payment\" to bolster ChatGPT and Copilot. With the app, users can quickly call up ChatGPT by using the keyboard combination of Option + Space. The app allows users to upload files and other photos, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\n\nAs of May 2024, the free version of ChatGPT can get responses from both the GPT-4o model and the web. It will only pull its answer from, and ultimately list, a handful of sources instead of showing nearly endless search results. Generative AI models of this type are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, including websites, books, news articles, and more. There are also privacy concerns regarding generative AI companies using your data to fine-tune their models further, which has become a common practice.\n\nOpenAI's update notably didn't include any information on the expected monetization opportunities for developers listing their apps on the storefront. Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting. OpenAI has suspended AI startup Delphi, which developed a bot impersonating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) to help bolster his presidential campaign.\n\nYou can also access ChatGPT via an app on your iPhone or Android device. However, per today's announcement, there has been no mention of video within GPT-4 and the only multi-modal element is the inputting of images -- far less than what Chat GPT was expected. What this means in practice is that the AI chatbot will be able to analyze what is in an image. For example, it can tell the user what is unusual about the below photo of a man ironing his clothes while attached to a taxi.\n\nResearchers have created bacteria that are immune to viral infections. Viruses exploit the universality of the genetic code, so \"if you change this language, then you can achieve a situation where you don't have this cross communication anymore\", synthetic biologist Akos Nyerges tells the Nature Podcast. The virus-proof bacteria have a slimmed-down genetic code, and their protein-producing machinery deliberately inserts the wrong amino acid into viral proteins. The method could make biomolecule-producing cells resistant to viral infections and reduce unwanted sharing of genes from modified organisms. The team at Springer Nature is building a new digital product that profiles research institutions. We're looking for postdoctoral researchers who are available for one hour on 30 March to speak to us (virtually) about our mock-up."

    "content": "Over the past year alone, the world's most closely watched AI company has hired more than half a dozen political insiders who are well-connected to the Democratic establishment, from Bill Clinton's former spin doctor Chris Lehane to Kamala Harris' one-time bestie Debbie Mesloh and ex-Sen. Laphonza Butler.\n\nIt's a notable deviation at a time when much of Silicon Valley is more focused on staffing up to chase influence in Republican-controlled Washington. And it's among the most aggressive pushes to date from a tech company into Sacramento and other corridors of power in a state that birthed the industry, yet where firms had long been reluctant to engage directly at the levels of other major sectors.\n\nBut it underscores how OpenAI sees its deep-blue home of California as vital for its global ambitions -- tied to a planned business makeover that the state's top attorney can summarily shut down.\n\n\"They're bringing in some very big guns to make their case,\" said Orson Aguilar, president of the nonprofit LatinoProsperity and prominent critic of OpenAI's business transformation plans within the state.\n\n\"Since the stakes are so high here for their profit, they're willing to spend what it takes to get their way with the California attorney general,\" added Aguilar, a seasoned civic leader.\n\nPOLITICO interviewed two dozen people who have interacted directly with the company, worked with its new hires or demanded answers about OpenAI's business moves.\n\nThe conversations revealed how recent recruits have drawn on tactics from the campaign trail and from warding off political scandals; from raising doubts about critics to burnishing the company's public perception through links to respected California figures such as Dolores Huerta, who co-founded the United Farm Workers with C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nAt the heart of their campaign is OpenAI's bid to change its business model, which is facing a lawsuit from Musk -- the company's co-founder turned rival -- as well as an investigation by California Attorney General Rob Bonta. Central to the approach is sniffing out any potential whiff of Musk -- a divisive figure to Californians and the omnipresent boogeyman in OpenAI's righteous, dare they contend, underdog quest -- when new criticisms arise, POLITICO's reporting shows.\n\nFounded as a nonprofit, OpenAI views the restructuring -- which could attract hundreds of billions of dollars from investors -- as the only way to keep up with the industry's global cash dash. It says the changes are necessary to continue the nonprofit's founding mission of ensuring human-like artificial intelligence benefits all.\n\nBut that new structure has to first clear the circling Democratic regulators and intensifying public scrutiny in California. The hires have been messaging that the company can still be a force for good, while defusing backlash from skeptics who argue OpenAI has put profit over mission.\n\nThey've also sought to make the stakes feel just as high for California, which depends on the tech industry's tax revenue to fill its coffers and has already seen some big companies, including those run by Musk, leave amid clashes with regulators and complaints about an unfriendly business climate.\n\n\"That's a question that folks should be thinking about because I do think that we want to be here,\" said Lehane -- now OpenAI's chief global affairs officer -- in an interview. \"So I'm hoping folks make the right decision.\"\n\nThe players\n\nThe campaign manager of OpenAI's political strategy has been Lehane, who earned the nickname \"master of disaster\" during his Clinton days, handling the Monica Lewinsky affair and other scandals. He literally wrote the guidebook for politicians on damage control, and was also Al Gore's press secretary.\n\nKnown for his sometimes theatrical strokes and quiet, often-unreported counseling sessions with bold-faced names throughout Democratic politics, he later guided billionaire climate crusader Tom Steyer's deep-pocketed electoral efforts (including his flirtation with a 2016 U.S. Senate run ultimately undertaken and won by Harris) before making a jump to the tech world with Airbnb in 2015.\n\nThe San Francisco resident joined OpenAI last summer in the aftermath of internal upheaval that rocked the company: a boardroom coup that briefly removed Altman as CEO.\n\nLehane told POLITICO that dating back to his time leading global policy at Airbnb, he's modeled his operations off a political campaign \"in the sense that you really want to integrate a public narrative with real, substantive ideas.\"\n\nBut not as in \"running negative political ads,\" he was quick to clarify.\n\nLehane's campaign analogy extends to how he has organized the new recruits, dividing them between communications, policy and field assignments. (The opposition researchers, be they in-house talent or hired guns, have thus far managed to remain anonymous.)\n\nSince Lehane took over, OpenAI's global affairs team has staffed up with Gavin Newsom and Bill de Blasio alum Peter Ragone; Harris' old campaign confidant and friend Mesloh; and Marisa Moret, who was chief of staff for the San Francisco city attorney while Harris was district attorney. Moret was Lehane's right hand at Airbnb, and reports to him again at OpenAI.\n\nRagone, a bicoastal fast-talker who revels in piecing together complex political relationships by closely following contribution breadcrumbs, is a damage control expert himself who met Lehane during the 1990s. In the New York mayor's office, he attempted to smooth over public perception amid de Blasio's rift with a prominent police union following the 2014 shooting of two officers.\n\nWhile Newsom was mayor of San Francisco, Ragone helped the current governor navigate an affair he had with the wife of his campaign manager. Recently, he worked on billionaire shopping mall magnate Rick Caruso's unsuccessful run for Los Angeles mayor and is a confidant of Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis.\n\nRagone's interest in AI and tech policy can be traced back years. He circulated memos to Newsom and other policymakers on the topic well before signing on with OpenAI.\n\nAnn O'Leary, another Newsom alum who served as the governor's first chief of staff and co-directed Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential transition team, is spearheading some of OpenAI's recent legal activities.\n\nNow an attorney at Jenner & Block, she's at the center of the company's dealings with investigations by both California's attorney general, Bonta, and Kathleen Jennings, attorney general for Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated. O'Leary's role has also involved probing opponents and drawing parallels to Musk.\n\nLehane has additionally turned to outside consultants, namely former Harris campaign manager Brian Brokaw and his business partner Dan Newman, for help crafting OpenAI's public image.\n\nThe two longtime Newsom advisers have a track record of blending campaign chops with insider relationships in Sacramento and the Bay Area to try to move other controversial initiatives forward, such as the billionaire-backed California Forever project to build a new tech world utopia north of San Francisco.\n\nAt the same time, they've managed to stay close with multiple top officials, from Bonta to San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, while quietly assembling a portfolio of corporations in crisis. Brokaw and Newman formed a pro-Lurie committee to raise money for his successful City Hall bid.\n\nOpenAI brought on multiple hires with tight ties to Harris when she was still considered a potentially field-clearing contender in the 2026 governor's race and even in the midst of her presidential run last year. Harris only ruled out a run to replace Newsom in late July.\n\nButler, whom Newsom personally hand-picked to fill the late California Sen. Dianne Feinstein's seat, is advising OpenAI as well, POLITICO first reported. Before the Senate, Butler was the longtime leader of a prominent labor group in California and a campaign adviser to Harris via the same political firm where Newman used to work. Butler's previous consulting clients include ride-hailing giant Uber and Airbnb, where she overlapped with Lehane and Moret.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the restructuring was among the issues Butler works on. The company declined requests to interview other members of Lehane's team.\n\nNeither Newsom's office nor Harris' representatives responded to requests for comment on their former staff.\n\nThe playbook\n\nLehane is credited with teaching Silicon Valley how to play politics, first at Airbnb, then at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, where he was an architect of its emergence as an election-swaying force.\n\nAt OpenAI, he has to move differently. The company's nonprofit status prevents it from launching a PAC or giving to candidates. And AI's promise as a sweeping, general-purpose technology blunts Lehane's usual playbook of crafting a core constituency around a cause like he did with the crypto voter.\n\nBut one constant remains: Lehane has no shortage of opponents, with Musk, respected California-based charities, a group of the company's former employees, leading academics, Nobel laureates and others all lining up against the restructuring.\n\nThey worry that OpenAI's new corporate setup will put financial interests ahead of, and divert funds away from, its charitable mission. That goes back to its 2015 founding as a nonprofit by those who believed the structure was the most responsible way to steer such powerful technology.\n\nOpenAI originally set out last year to convert into a for-profit organization, but changed course in May amid scrutiny from state officials. The updated plan -- to turn its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation that the nonprofit controls as a stakeholder -- is turning out to be no quick feat either and still requires the blessing of the attorneys general in both California and Delaware, not to mention key investor Microsoft.\n\nChanging the structure of its for-profit arm would also eliminate the current capped-profit model.\n\nThe most pressing motivator and deadline for OpenAI is an investment led by SoftBank -- $20 billion of which is contingent on the restructuring being finished by the end of the year.\n\nState decision-makers don't appear to be in a rush, though.\n\nBonta in California has hired outside help to go through OpenAI's financials for his probe, and Jennings in Delaware plans to take similar steps. Bonta's office met with OpenAI executives -- Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon, head of U.S. and Canada policy Chan Park, deputy general counsel Che Chang and associate general counsel Nora Puckett.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the meeting was unrelated to the restructuring and declined to discuss specifics beyond that the company has been responsive to Bonta's staff. A deputy attorney general for Bonta denied a records request related to the meeting, citing his ongoing investigation.\n\nEllie Blume, a special assistant attorney general, separately heard concerns from civic groups like the San Francisco Foundation in May and July meetings.\n\n\"They didn't give us that much of a sense of the timeline,\" said Judith Bell, the foundation's chief impact officer, with whom Aguilar formed a coalition over the cause. The OpenAI spokesperson added the company does not have a timeline for resolution either.\n\nFurther down the line, OpenAI has ambitions to go public. Unlike nonprofits, public benefit corporations can list their shares, and OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, said at the Dublin Tech Summit in May that the restructuring sets it up for a potential IPO.\n\nSome nonprofit leaders in the state point to those financial incentives to explain OpenAI's hiring spree.\n\nIn light of the SoftBank agreement, OpenAI could \"spend a billion dollars on this and still come out $19 billion net positive,\" said Tyler Johnston, the executive director of the nonprofit Midas Project, which has questioned the restructuring.\n\nLehane will tell you OpenAI wants to share its riches with California and grow there. Part of his mission is to lay out the stakes for the world's fourth-largest economy if it leaves. He recently wrote directly to Newsom in a letter first reported by POLITICO, petitioning the state to change course on AI regulations or risk losing its place as the home of innovation.\n\nOpenAI has heard pitches from state leaders across the U.S. looking to lure it away. Companies like Oracle and Musk's Tesla, SpaceX and X Corp. have moved their headquarters to Texas while retaining a California presence.\n\n\"We want to be here,\" Lehane told POLITICO. \"But we also do really want to have a structure that allows us to deliver on our mission and purpose.\"\n\nThe opposition\n\nLehane popularized the phrase \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" when defending the Clintons. It referred to how the internet age has allowed fringe theories to pass up to the masses, but was often used by the politicians he represented to cast themselves as the victim of a shadowy cabal.\n\nA recurring theme of Lehane's California operation, as many critics point out, is a persistent suspicion that rivals such as Musk are secretly behind those who have challenged OpenAI's business plans.\n\nOpenAI launched a countersuit against Musk's restructuring lawsuit, alleging unfair business practices as he expands his competitor, xAI. A federal judge recently said that case could proceed.\n\nOne group the company has fixated on is the recently formed Coalition for AI Nonprofit Integrity, which backed a bill in California this year that would have effectively stopped OpenAI's restructuring altogether. The bill was ultimately gutted and amended by its author with little explanation, but OpenAI has continued seeking to unmask the nonprofit -- despite its repeated denials of any association with Musk.\n\nO'Leary lodged a complaint with California's top campaign finance watchdog to ask for an investigation into the group. She also subpoenaed CANI as part of the Musk lawsuit, looking for any ties. The legal filings obtained by POLITICO reveal a level of digging common in opposition research. OpenAI's lawyers enlisted professional research services, cold-called everyone they could find with the same name as CANI's listed leader and reviewed his property records.\n\nSpokespeople for Musk and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk has come up during interactions between OpenAI and more established organizations in the state as well. In June, OpenAI gathered with members of Aguilar and Bell's nonprofit coalition on a video call, ostensibly to allay concerns and explain its evolving plans.\n\nLess than a quarter of the coalition's 60 members joined. But it was the largest meeting between OpenAI and several of its most influential challengers in the state, the details of which POLITICO is first reporting based on the accounts of eight participants, some of whom were granted anonymity to discuss the private exchange.\n\nThe groups had asked to meet Altman, Aguilar said, and instead faced O'Leary, Moret and Mesloh. (OpenAI said in a statement that the attendees did not formally request Altman's attendance at the meeting.)\n\nGroup leaders told POLITICO they were taken aback when the three OpenAI reps began by trying to determine if anyone had received money from Musk.\n\n\"As I'm sure you're aware, there are lots of other organizations who are pursuing commercial interests,\" an OpenAI representative said, according to contemporaneous notes taken by someone on the call and seen by POLITICO. \"Some of the organizations are funded by Elon Musk.\"\n\nTwo other attendees recounted that the suggestion came from O'Leary.\n\nA \"strange\" and \"very combative way to start,\" Bell said. Catherine Bracy, CEO and co-founder of TechEquity, who was on the call, dismissed the notion that they were doing Musk's bidding as \"ludicrous and offensive.\"\n\nOne participant said O'Leary was familiar with their organization from her time in Newsom's administration, which made the company's questioning of its background all the more puzzling.\n\nParticipants said they asked for clarification and pushed back on the notion that anyone was supported by Musk. O'Leary expressed little surprise at the groups' denials, which two call attendees interpreted as confirmation she was already aware.\n\nIt was, a lawyer on the call would write in notes, \"the first time\" some OpenAI staff had witnessed the coalition's \"hostility\" toward the company firsthand.\n\nThe groups left frustrated, expressing that sentiment in a letter to Bonta on June 26, telling him the OpenAI staffers could not answer the majority of their queries, and that he should keep up the investigation. The coalition argued even the revised structure that retains nonprofit control \"fails to provide adequate safeguards for the public, the nonprofit's charitable assets, and its charitable mission.\"\n\nMany later speculated that OpenAI's portrayal of opponents as Musk-backed stooges who want to derail the company's progress for personal gain was a ploy to undermine them and dodge tough questions about the purpose of the restructuring.\n\n\"A lot of people in California don't like Elon Musk,\" said Aguilar. \"They feel like they're taking away our credibility. It's a poor PR tactic with really poor taste.\"\n\nStill, a few thought OpenAI's concern was somewhat genuine, perhaps even justified, considering the bad blood between Altman and Musk.\n\n\"It's clear to me that their sense that Elon is behind this is animating a lot of their strategy,\" said Bracy. \"Elon's Elon, so I guess I don't really blame them for thinking that this is something he would do.\"\n\nWhile the confrontations with critics are not easing opposition, OpenAI has seen some minor wins.\n\nOne of the participants on the call, the philanthropic investment firm Omidyar Network, created by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, decided not to sign the coalition's late June letter to Bonta, after its CEO Mike Kubzansky shared during the meeting that the group owns shares in OpenAI's competitor Anthropic. Omidyar Network had signed all previous correspondence to Bonta.\n\n\"While our small stake in Anthropic (which was already a matter of public record) had zero bearing in our engagement with the coalition, we felt it was important to remove any doubt about the coalition's motives,\" Omidyar spokesperson Alexis Krieg said in a statement.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment further on the meeting.\n\nSeparately, a PR firm dropped CANI as a client once it joined Actum, an influential consultancy where OpenAI adviser Butler is a partner.\n\nThe small PR firm's co-founder, Becky Warren, had previously accused OpenAI of turning to \"bullying tactics\" and \"doing whatever they can to distract.\" CANI's new spokesperson, Tiffany Moffatt, borrowed OpenAI's campaign analogy to describe its strategy.\n\n\"OpenAI, which has enjoyed non-profit status under California's tax laws, has aggressively lobbied to dismantle legislation safeguarding that status, deploying top-tier national political consultants and lawyers to intimidate and silence opposition,\" she said. \"This ruthless campaign has left CANI members fearful of retaliation.\"\n\nMoffatt declined to share CANI's founders because of those fears and described the nonprofit as \"a genuine grassroots coalition of concerned citizens.\"\n\nThe mystery around CANI has left an opening for OpenAI to call other organizations into question. O'Leary told California's campaign finance watchdog earlier this month that CANI may be channeling its efforts through another AI safety group in Aguilar's coalition, Encode. Sunny Gandhi, vice president of political affairs at Encode, said her insinuation was \"flat out incorrect.\"\n\n\"I don't think OpenAI truly cares that much about this group,\" Aguilar said of CANI. \"The message is clear: They want to paint themselves as the good guys, and everybody else, including us, we must be doing something wrong or colluding with somebody if we're getting in their way.\"\n\nThe PR plan\n\nYet another way OpenAI has deployed its political muscle is through a listening tour to rethink the company's philanthropic efforts post-restructuring.\n\nLehane is a believer in the campaign mainstay of not just slamming the other camp's ideas, but offering an alternative vision of his own.\n\n\"You can't just be against everything,\" he once told the Airbnb board. \"You have to be for something.\"\n\nOpenAI earlier this year formed an advisory commission featuring former Newsom adviser Daniel Zingale, a close friend of O'Leary, labor icon Dolores Huerta and others from nonprofit circles to draft an independent report for its board on how the company should use its vast resources to have the largest positive impact.\n\nIn March, Mesloh and Moret previewed the panel to civic leaders by introducing Zingale at the San Francisco Foundation headquarters. The meeting was brokered by a third party, the former chair of the Latino Community Foundation, Dan Skaff, according to Aguilar.\n\nFor months, Zingale and the commission's advisers crisscrossed the state, holding meetings to take input from different community groups. Several advocates who spoke to commission members said they perceived it as separate from the company, and Zingale said the group vigorously guarded its independence. He told POLITICO he never communicated with Altman while drafting the report.\n\nWhile Zingale is not an employee, tapping him to chart a path forward for a multibillion-dollar nonprofit is one more way Lehane has sought to work the public narrative in his favor. Zingale brought on Huerta, giving the recommendations the imprimatur of the legendary co-founder of the United Farm Workers at a time when labor groups fear AI will increasingly take jobs away from workers.\n\nHuerta, too, has decades of deep ties to Democratic politicians. She supported Harris during the 2020 primary and campaigned with her in 2024, supporting Democratic candidates dating back to Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nShe told POLITICO that she met with some of OpenAI's researchers, but no members of the board or leadership. \"We didn't ask to meet with them, and they didn't ask to meet with us,\" she said.\n\nHuerta said she had \"no idea\" why she was asked to sit on the commission, but guessed it was because of her civil rights background. She said she didn't know if her agreeing to it had helped the company's reputation in California, as it faces regulatory scrutiny. (Both of Bonta's parents were involved in UFW organizing.)\n\nThe commission's report strongly endorsed a nonprofit model for OpenAI with an oversight role for attorneys general and imagined the company as a new kind of philanthropic force. The advisers want OpenAI to fund a wide mix of ideas to prepare for AI's growing presence in everyday life, from supporting public parks and other common areas as AI-free spaces to research on the technology's safety risks.\n\nThe day of the report's release, OpenAI held court with more than 1,000 nonprofit leaders at events across the country. It committed $50 million to fund civic group initiatives the next day, which Lehane said could come with additional AI tools, as part of his messaging on the good the company is prepared to do if regulators allow it to operate as it wants.\n\n\"Our single best lobbyist is our innovation,\" Lehane said. A key piece of his approach, he added, has been to \"forge partnerships with stakeholders and entities that are going to be particularly relevant to the public conversation\" and show them OpenAI's technology.\n\nBecause the report is not binding, groups that weighed in are counting on Bonta to set the course.\n\n\"This is the largest nonprofit ever,\" Bell said of why there has been such intense interest in the issue. \"We are talking about a scale that we simply have never seen before.\"\n\nLehane, too, is wielding that fact publicly, as Bonta weighs what to do with his investigation and OpenAI's billions of dollars remain, for now, headquartered in California.\n\nOpenAI recently appealed directly to Newsom and state lawmakers, sending them a curated report about the company's economic impact on the state, first reported by POLITICO. It was compiled by former Biden White House official Ronnie Chatterjee, now OpenAI's chief economist, and outlined the billions in revenue the state would lose if the company packs up, reaching nearly $6 billion in total economic impact in 2030.\n\n\"There is no state or country in the world today that would not want to be California when it comes to AI,\" the report stated. But it warned: \"Provided, that is, that the state doesn't drive AI out of California through well-intended but not well-understood overregulation.\""

    "content": "OpenAI's ChatGPT is one of the latest technological breakthroughs in the artificial intelligence space. But what is ChatGPT, and can you invest in OpenAI?\n\nThis emerging technology is representative of a niche subsector of the AI industry known as generative AI -- systems that can generate text, images or sounds in response to prompts given by users.\n\nPrecedence Research expects the global AI market to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.2 percent to reach US$3.68 trillion by 2034. Just how much of an impact OpenAI's ChatGPT will have on this space is hard to predict, but Fortune Business Insights estimates that the total market revenue of generative AI will see a CAGR of 39.6 percent through 2032, increasing from US$67.18 billion last year to US$967.65 billion in 2032.\n\nIn September 2024, Reuters reported that OpenAI was planning a restructuring from a non-profit to a for-profit company in order to make it \"more attractive to investors.\" However, after encountering backlash and potential legal conflicts, in May 2025 OpenAI's management decided to remain a non-profit while still converting its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation.\n\nOpenAI completed a new round of funding totaling US$40 billion in late March 2025 projected to bring its valuation to US$300 billion. Japanese multinational investment firm SoftBank made up 75 percent of the funding, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and investment firms Coatue Management, Altimeter Capital and Thrive Capital also took part in the raise.\n\nThe US Department of Defense (DoD) awarded a US$200 million contract to OpenAI in June 2025 to provide the DoD with artificial intelligence tools for addressing national security challenges, including cyber defense and warfare.\n\nMany investors are wondering if it's possible to invest in ChatGPT stock, and if there are other ways to invest in generative AI. Here the Investing News Network (INN) answers those questions and more, shedding light on this new landscape.\n\nIn this article\n\nWhat is OpenAI's ChatGPT?\n\nCreated by San Francisco-based tech lab OpenAI, ChatGPT is a generative AI software application that uses a machine learning technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to emulate human-written conversations based on a large range of user prompts. This kind of software is better known as an AI chatbot.\n\nChatGPT learns language by training on texts gleaned from across the internet, including online encyclopedias, books, academic journals, news sites and blogs. Based on this training, the AI chatbot generates text by making predictions about which words (or tokens) can be strung together to produce the most suitable response.\n\nMore than a million people engaged with ChatGPT within the first week of its launch for free public testing on November 30, 2022. The introduction of ChatGPT quickly ushered in a new era in the tech industry.\n\n\"With the launch of ChatGPT late in 2022, the true scale of its disruptive potential was more realized across the world in 2023,\" said Naseem Husain, senior vice president and exchange-traded fund (ETF) strategist at Horizons ETFs, in an interview with the Investing News Network. \"Its success has sparked a wave of generative and chat AI models, from Midjourney to Grok.\"\n\nBased on this success, OpenAI created a more powerful version of the ChatGPT system called GPT-4, which was released in March 2023. This iteration of ChatGPT can accept visual inputs, is much more precise and can display a higher level of expertise in various subjects. Because of this, GPT-4 can describe images in vivid detail and ace standardized tests.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, GPT-4 doesn't have any time limits on what information it can access; however, AI researcher and professor Dr. Oren Etzioni has said that the chatbot is still terrible at discussing the future and generating new ideas. It also hasn't lost its tendency to deliver incorrect information with too high a degree of confidence.\n\nFurther improving on its product, in May 2024 OpenAI launched Chat GPT-4o, with the o standing for omni. OpenAI describes GPT-4o as \"a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction -- it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs.\"\n\nThis version has done away with the lagging response time afflicting GPT-4. This proves especially helpful for producing immediate translations during conversations between speakers of different languages. It also allows users to interrupt the chatbot to pose a new query to modify responses.\n\nMore recently, in December 2024, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Pro subscriptions targeting engineers and academics. For US$200 monthly, users have nearly unlimited access to all ChatGPT models and tools.\n\nThe ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT-4 platforms are free to use, and can be accessed via the web. Those with an iPhone or iPad can also use ChatGPT through an app, and an Android version launched in July 2023. OpenAI also launched a paid subscription, ChatGPT Plus for business use, in August 2023. ChatGPT Plus gives users access to GPT-4 and the newest iteration GPT-4o.\n\nWhat is the Stargate Project?\n\nThe Stargate Project is an AI joint venture focused on building new AI infrastructure in the US through US$500 billion in investments. It was announced on January 21, 2025.\n\nStargate's initial funding is coming from OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and UAE-based technology fund MGX. In addition to OpenAI and Oracle, Stargate's technology partners include Microsoft, NVIDIA, and British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM).\n\nNewly re-elected US President Trump unveiled Stargate during a press conference at the White House highlighting the importance of investment in US AI infrastructure. During the announcement, OpenAI's Altman, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son credited President Trump's return to office as a major catalyst in making Stargate a reality. The construction of data centers for the Stargate Project are already underway in Texas, according to Ellison.\n\nHow much has Microsoft invested in OpenAI?\n\nAscannio / Shutterstock\n\nOver the years, Microsoft has reportedly invested nearly US$14 billion in OpenAI to help the small tech firm create its ultra-powerful AI chatbot.\n\nAs for how Microsoft could benefit from its investment in OpenAI, OpenAI officially licensed its technologies to Microsoft in 2020 in a then-exclusive partnership. Indeed, Pitchbook has described the deal as an \"unprecedented milestone\" for generative AI technology. Since then, Microsoft has made good use of OpenAI's technology in developing new advancement in its Azure cloud computing business.\n\nHowever, the relationship between the two has changed in recent months.\n\nNotably, Microsoft is not a financier of the Stargate Project joint venture, and is instead just described as a technology partner. According to OpenAI's press release, the new joint venture builds on its existing partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft's lack of a funding role in Stargate led some to wonder if the trillion-dollar tech firm had soured on its relationship with OpenAI. This conclusion was understandable given reports that Microsoft refused to make a bigger contribution than the US$750 million it invested during the OpenAI US$6.6 billion funding round in October 2024.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft changed the contract between the two companies and is no longer the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI, but has the right of first refusal for deals the AI firm may make with other cloud companies.\n\nAs Bloomberg technology reporter Dina Bass explained, Microsoft stands to benefit from its role as a technology partner without having to invest a dime into the project.\n\n\"Microsoft views the revised contract with OpenAI as advantageous, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. The software giant retains its share of OpenAI's revenue and is the largest investor in a company that may now become even more valuable -- though the size of that stake could change as the startup works to restructure as a for-profit,\" wrote Bass. \"And Microsoft also still has access to OpenAI models, even if they're trained in a data center funded by Softbank or Oracle.\"\n\nYet, there are reports that Microsoft and OpenAI's relationship is on the brink of a big breakup. The tech giant has been pushing for a much larger percentage of OpenAI's revenues than the 20 percent it currently enjoys. According to the Wall Street Journal, OpenAI is considering making antitrust complaints about Microsoft to regulators even though the two companies are still undergoing high level discussions about the future of the partnership.\n\nElon Musk's position on OpenAI\n\nDIA TV / Shutterstock\n\nOpenAI was founded in 2015 by Altman, its current CEO, as well as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and other big-name investors, such as venture capitalist Peter Thiel and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Musk left his position on OpenAI's board of directors in 2018 to focus on Tesla and its pursuit of autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nA few days after ChatGPT became available for public testing, Musk took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to say, \"ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.\" That same day, he announced that X had shut the door on OpenAI's access to its database so it could no longer use it for RLHF training.\n\nHis reason: \"OpenAI was started as open-source & non-profit. Neither are still true.\"\n\nFurthering his feud with OpenAI, Musk filed a lawsuit against the company in March 2024 for an alleged breach of contract. The crux of his complaint was that OpenAI has broken the \"founding agreement\" made between the founders (Altman, Greg Brockman and himself) that the company would remain a non-profit. Altman and OpenAI have denied there was such an agreement and that Musk was keen on an eventual for-profit structure.\n\nMusk dropped the lawsuit three months later without giving a reason, reported Reuters. The day before he dropped the lawsuit, he reacted to the news that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is partnering with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT with Apple devices. On X, Musk declared, \"If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS (operating system) level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation.\" It should be noted that OpenAI has said queries completed on Apple devices will not be stored by OpenAI. By August 2024, Musk had resumed his litigation in federal court.\n\nIt seems that the US government also has questions about the restructuring of the private company and the involvement of tech giant Microsoft, as reported by Bloomberg. In early January 2025, the Financial Press also reported the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has raised questions about the potential anti-trust violations in the newly emerging AI technology space arising from Microsoft's partnership with and investments in OpenAI.\n\nOf course, Musk took to X to weigh in on the Stargate Project, suggesting OpenAI and its partners don't actually have the US$500 million they've pledged to invest. Sam Altman was quick to reply, telling Musk he's mistaken and inviting him to visit their data center under construction in Texas.\n\nHowever, Musk is not alone in his skepticism. For example, Atreides Management Chief Investment Office Gavin Baker also questioned the deal on X. \"Stargate is a great name but the $500b is a ridiculous number and no one should take it seriously,\" Baker wrote, backing up his statement by explaining the financial positions of each of the partners. \"Nowhere close to $500b. Everyone should just start issuing press releases for $1 trillion AI projects.\"\n\nOpenAI criticisms and lawsuits\n\nWhile ChatGPT has served as a major step forward in generative AI technology, there are many technical and ethical concerns with the program that have emerged since it launched, including fears over job destruction and targeted disinformation campaigns.\n\nAccuracy of information in ChatGPT's answers is not guaranteed. Its selection of which words to string together are actually predictions -- not as fallible as mere guesses, but still fallible. Even the 4.0 version is \"still is not fully reliable (it \"hallucinates\" facts and makes reasoning errors),\" says the company, which emphasizes that users should exercise caution when employing the technology.\n\nIndeed, ChatGPT's failings can have dangerous real-life consequences. Among other negative applications, the tech can be used to spread misinformation, carry out phishing email scams or write malicious code.\n\nThere's also the fear among teachers that the technology is leading to an unwelcome rise in academic dishonesty, with students using ChatGPT to write essays or complete their homework.\n\n\"Teachers and school administrators have been scrambling to catch students using the tool to cheat, and they are fretting about the havoc ChatGPT could wreak on their lesson plans,\" writes New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose.\n\nMany lawsuits against OpenAI have emerged as well. Multiple news outlets, including the the New York Times, have launched copyright lawsuits against OpenAI, and some of the plaintiffs are also seeking damages from the private tech firm's very public partner Microsoft.\n\nAdditionally, the Authors Guild, which represents a group of prominent authors, launched a class-action lawsuit against OpenAI that is calling for a licensing system that would allow authors to opt out of having their books used to train AI, and would require AI companies to pay for the material they do use.\n\nIn October, OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji blew the whistle on the company, reporting that the firm was violating US copyright laws. He died one month later in what was ruled a suicide, but the investigation is still open.\n\nCybersecurity risks are also a concern for ChatGPT users, and recent events along these lines add validity to Musk's warning. For one, in 2024 ChatGPT for macOS was discovered to be breaching Apple's security rules by storing data as plain text rather than encryption, making it possible for other apps to access.\n\nWhat's the future of OpenAI and ChatGPT?\n\nWhat about the long-term goals for OpenAI and ChatGPT? For most of the tech leaders in this space, the end game is artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- a system that can perform any function the human brain can, including self-teaching, abstract thinking and understanding cause and effect.\n\nAs uptake increases, AI technology is taking over the role of humans and will likely continue doing so in a number of fields, from content creation and customer service to transcription and translation services, and even in graphic design, software engineering and paralegal fields.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft's use of the ChatGPT technology as part of Copilot, other companies are working with OpenAI to incorporate the technology into their platforms, including Canva, Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL), Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE), Intercom, Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM), Stripe, Tinder, Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) and Visa (NYSE:V).\n\nFor 2025, OpenAI is focusing on developing agentic AI capabilities into its ChatGPT platform. Agentic AI, a part of the evolution towards AGI, involves AI systems and models that can act autonomously and complete tasks without much human guidance. Early in January, OpenAI announced the rollout of new task features for ChatGPT Pro, Plus and Teams users. While still in the beta stage, these features allow users to schedule future tasks to be completed by ChatGPT, such as a weekly news brief or reminders about important meetings.\n\nOpenAI first debuted its foray into agentic AI in September 2024 with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, stating \"We've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.\" The release of the next iterations of this model, ChatGPT o3 mini and o4 mini happened in the first half of 2025.\n\nThe recent release of Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI assistant may present a problem for OpenAI and the US tech industry as a whole. In what tech gurus like Marc Andreesen call AI's Sputnik moment, DeepSeek unseated ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app in the Apple App Store, at reportedly a fraction of the cost. For reference, in 1957 the Soviets launched Sputnik, the earth's first artificial satellite, beating out the United States and sparking a Cold War space exploration race between the two nations.\n\nThe DeepSeek launch set off a significant sell off in technology stocks on January 27, 2025, especially among the Magnificent Seven members, including NVIDIA, Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nWhen will OpenAI go public?\n\nOpenAI stock is not currently publicly traded, and following the May 2025 decision to remain a non-profit, there are no signs of an on initial public offering (IPO) in the works for 2025. For now, investors can gain exposure through related tech companies discussed below.\n\nWhich stocks will benefit the most from AI chatbot technology?\n\nWhile most companies specializing in generative AI remain in the venture capital stage, there are plenty of AI stocks for those interested in the space. INN's article 5 Canadian Artificial Intelligence Stocks, ASX AI Stocks: 5 Biggest Companies, Global AI Stocks: 9 Biggest Companies in 2025 and 12 Generative AI Stocks to Watch as ChatGPT Soars includes some examples.\n\nOther than companies directly tied to generative AI technology, which stocks are likely to get a boost from generative AI advancements?\n\nThere are several verticals in the tech industry with indirect exposure to AI chatbot technology, such as semiconductors, network equipment providers, cloud providers, central processing unit manufacturers and internet of things.\n\nSome of the publicly traded companies in these verticals include:\n\n* Graphics processing unit leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\n* The world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM)\n\n* Computer memory and data storage producer Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)\n\n* Digital communications firm Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\n* Networking products provider Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR)\n\n* Semiconductor producer Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL)\n\n* Cloud-computing Amazon Web Services' parent company Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\n* Bluechip multinational technology company IBM (NYSE:IBM)\n\n* Major semiconductor chip manufacturer Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nInvestors who don't like to put all their eggs in one basket can check out these 5 Artificial Intelligence ETFs.

Generative AI is also a major theme in the Top 10 Emerging Technologies to Watch.\n\nFAQs for investing in OpenAI and ChatGPT\n\nHow is OpenAI funded?\n\nOpenAI raised US$57.9 billion over 11 funding rounds from 2016 to March 2025.\n\nTop investors include technology investment firm Thrive Capital, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and revolutionary technology investment firm Founders Fund.\n\nWhat is the market value of ChatGPT/OpenAI?\n\nOpenAI has a market valuation of US$300 billion as of June 2025. The company's annualized revenue reached the US$10 billion mark in June 2025, up from the US$5.5 billion achieved in December 2024.\n\nDoes ChatGPT use NVIDIA chips?\n\nChatGPT's distributed computing infrastructure depends upon powerful servers with multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). High-performance NVIDIA GPU chips are preferred for this application as they also provide excellent Compute Unified Device Architecture support.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that launched new AI-driven, open-source language models known as DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 into the market in January 2025. Reuters reports that \"the training of DeepSeek-V3 required less than $6 million worth of computing power from Nvidia H800 chips.\"\n\nDeepSeek-R1 is designed to compete with the performance of OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\n\nCan ChatGPT make stock predictions?\n\nA University of Florida study from 2023 highlighted the potential for advanced language models such as ChatGPT to accurately predict movements in the stock market using sentiment analysis.\n\nDuring the course of the study, ChatGPT outperformed traditional sentiment analysis methods, and the finance professors conducting the research concluded that \"incorporating advanced language models into the investment decision-making process can yield more accurate predictions and enhance the performance of quantitative trading strategies.\"\n\nWhen to expect ChatGPT 5?\n\nIn June 2025, during an OpenAI podcast Sam Altman responded with, \"Probably some time this summer,\" when asked about when the market can expect to see ChatGPT-5.\n\nPreviously, OpenAI filed a trademark application for ChatGPT-5 in mid-July 2023, which hinted that the next iteration of the generative AI technology is currently under development. There were rumors the company planned to complete training for ChatGPT-5 by the end of 2023, but this did not materialize. PC Guide noted in April 2024 that Sam Altman had teased an \"amazing new model this year\" in an interview on the Lex Fridman podcast.\n\nIn November 2024, Altman confirmed that ChatGPT-5 wouldn't likely hit the market until later in 2025 as the company switched its focus to ChatGPT o1 and its successors.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article first published by the Investing News Network in 2023.\n\nDon't forget to follow us @INN_Technology for real-time news updates!\n\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Melissa Pistilli, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Subscribe Now\n\nOpenAI is getting back to its roots as an open source AI company with today's announcement and release of two new, open source, frontier large language models (LLMs): gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b.\n\nThe former is a 120-billion parameter model as the name would suggest, capable of running on a single Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) and the latter is only 20 billion, small enough to run locally on a consumer laptop or desktop PC.\n\nBoth are text-only language models, which means unlike the multimodal AI that we've had for nearly two years that allows users to upload files and images and have the AI analyze them, users will be confined to only inputting text messages to the models and receiving text back out.\n\nHowever, they can still of course write code and provide math problems and numerics, and in terms of their performance on tasks, they rank above some of OpenAI's paid models and much of the competition globally.\n\nThey can also be connected to external tools including web search to perform research on behalf of the user. More on this below.\n\nMost importantly: they're free, they're available for enterprises and indie developers to download the code and use right now, modifying according to their needs, and can be run locally without a web connection, ensuring maximum privacy, unlike the other top OpenAI models and those from leading U.S.-based rivals Google and Anthropic.\n\nThe models can be downloaded today with full weights (the settings guiding its behavior) on the AI code sharing community Hugging Face and GitHub.\n\nHigh benchmark scores\n\nAccording to OpenAI, gpt-oss-120b matches or exceeds its proprietary o4-mini model on reasoning and tool-use benchmarks, including competition mathematics (AIME 2024 & 2025), general problem solving (MMLU and HLE), agentic evaluations (TauBench), and health-specific evaluations (HealthBench). The smaller gpt-oss-20b model is comparable to o3-mini and even surpasses it in some benchmarks.\n\nThe models are multilingual and perform well across a variety of non-English languages, though OpenAI declined to specify which and how many.\n\nWhile these capabilities are available out of the box, OpenAI notes that localized fine-tuning -- such as an ongoing collaboration with the Swedish government to produce a version fine-tuned on the country's language -- can still meaningfully enhance performance for specific regional or linguistic contexts.\n\nA hugely advantageous license for enterprises and privacy-minded users\n\nBut the biggest feature is the licensing terms for both: Apache 2.0, the same as the wave of Chinese open source models that have been released over the last several weeks, and a more enterprise-friendly license than Meta's trickier and more nuanced open-ish Llama license, which requires that users who operate a service with more than 700 million monthly active users obtain a paid license to keep using the company's family of LLMs.\n\nBy contrast, OpenAI's new gpt-oss series of models offer no such restrictions. In keeping with Chinese competitors and counterparts, any consumer, developer, independent entrepreneur or enterprise large and small is empowered by the Apache 2.0 license to be able to download the new gpt-oss models at will, fine-tune and alter them to fit their specific needs, and use them to generate revenue or operate paid services, all without paying OpenAI a dime (or anything!).\n\nThis also means enterprises can use a powerful, near topline OpenAI model on their own hardware totally privately and securely, without sending any data up to the cloud, on web servers, or anywhere else. For highly regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and legal services, not to mention organizations in military, intelligence, and government, this may be a requirement.\n\nBefore today, anyone using ChatGPT or its application programming interface (API) -- the service that acts like a switching board and allows third-party software developers to connect their own apps and services to these OpenAI's proprietary/paid models like GPT-4o and o3 -- was sending data up to OpenAI servers that could technically be subpoenaed by government agencies and accessed without a user's knowledge. That's still the case for anyone using ChatGPT or the API going forward, as OpenAI co-founder and Sam Altman recently warned.\n\nAnd while running the new gpt-oss models locally on a user's own hardware disconnected from the web would allow for maximum privacy, as soon as the user decides to connect it to external web search or other web enabled tools, some of the same privacy risks and issues would then arise -- through any third-party web services the user or developer was relying on when hooking the models up to said tools.\n\nThe last OpenAI open source language model was released more than six years ago\n\n\"This is the first time we're releasing an open-weight language model in a long time... We view this as complementary to our other products,\" said OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman on an embargoed press video call with VentureBeat and other journalists last night.\n\nThe last time OpenAI released a fully open source language model was GPT-2 in 2019, more than six years ago, and three years before the release of ChatGPT.\n\nThis fact has sparked the ire of -- and resulted in several lawsuits from -- former OpenAI co-founder and backer turned rival Elon Musk, who, along with many other critics, have spent the last several years accusing OpenAI of betraying its mission and founding principles and namesake by eschewing open source AI releases in favor of paid proprietary models available only to customers of OpenAI's API or paying ChatGPT subscribers (though there is a free tier for the latter).\n\nOpenAI co-founder CEO Sam Altman did express regret about being on the \"wrong side of history\" but not releasing more open source AI sooner in a Reddit AMA (ask me anything) QA with users in February of this year, and Altman committed to releasing a new open source model back in March, but ultimately the company delayed its release from a planned July date until now.\n\nNow OpenAI is tacking back toward open source, and the question is, why?\n\nWhy would OpenAI release a set of free open source models that it makes no money from?\n\nTo paraphrase Jesse Plemons' character's memorable line from the film Game Night: \"How can that be profitable for OpenAI?\"\n\nAfter all, business to OpenAI's paid offerings appears to be booming.\n\nRevenue has skyrocketed alongside the rapid expansion of its ChatGPT user base, now at 700 million weekly active users. As of August 2025, OpenAI reported $13 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from $10 billion in June. That growth is driven by a sharp rise in paying business customers -- now 5 million, up from 3 million just two months earlier -- and surging daily engagement, with over 3 billion user messages sent every day.\n\nThe financial momentum follows an $8.3 billion funding round that valued OpenAI at $300 billion and provides the foundation for the company's aggressive infrastructure expansion and global ambitions.\n\nCompare that to closed/proprietary rival AI startup Anthropic's reported $5 billion in total annual recurring revenue, but interestingly, Anthropic is said to be getting more money from its API, $3.1 billion in revenue compared to OpenAI's $2.9 billion, according to The Information.\n\nSo, given how well the paid AI business is already doing, the business strategy behind these open source offerings is less clear -- especially since the new OpenAI gpt-oss models will almost certainly cut into some (perhaps a lot of) usage of OpenAI's paid models. Why go back to offering open source LLMs now when so much money is flowing into paid and none will, by virtue of its very intent, go directly toward open source models?\n\nPut simply: because open source competitors, beginning with the release of the impressively efficient DeepSeek R1 by the Chinese AI division of the same name in January 2025, are offering near parity on performance benchmarks to paid proprietary models, for free, with fewer (basically zero) implementation restrictions for enterprises and end users. And increasingly, enterprises are adopting these open source models in production.\n\nAs OpenAI executives and team members revealed to VentureBeat and many other journalists on an embargoed video call last night about the new models that when it comes to OpenAI's API, the majority of customers are using a mix of paid OpenAI models and open source models from other providers. (I asked, but OpenAI declined to specify what percentage or total number of API customers are using open source models and which ones).\n\nAt least, until now. OpenAI clearly hopes these new gpt-oss offerings will get more of these users to switch away from competing open source offerings and back into OpenAI's ecosystem, even if OpenAI doesn't see any direct revenue or data from that usage.\n\nOn a grander scale, it seems OpenAI wants to be a full-service, full-stack, one-stop shop AI offering for all of an enterprise, indie developer's, or regular consumer's machine intelligence needs -- from a clean chatbot interface to an API to build services and apps atop of to agent frameworks for building AI agents through said API to an image generation model (gpt-4o native image generation), video model (Sora), audio transcription model (gpt-4o-transcribe), and now, open source offerings as well. Can a music generation and \"world model\" be far behind?\n\nOpenAI seeks to span the AI market, propriety and open source alike, even if the latter is worth nothing in terms of actual, direct dollars and cents.\n\nTraining and architecture\n\nFeedback from developers directly influenced gpt-oss's design. OpenAI says the top request was for a permissive license, which led to the adoption of Apache 2.0 for both models. Both models use a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with a Transformer backbone.\n\nThe larger gpt-oss-120b activates 5.1 billion parameters per token (out of 117 billion total), and gpt-oss-20b activates 3.6 billion (out of 21 billion total).\n\nBoth support 128,000 token context length (about 300-400 pages of a novel's worth of text a user can upload at once), and employ locally banded sparse attention and use Rotary Positional Embeddings for encoding.\n\nThe tokenizer -- the program that converts words and chunks of words into the numerical tokens that the LLMs can understand, dubbed \"o200k_harmony\" -- is also being open-sourced.\n\nDevelopers can select among low, medium, or high reasoning effort settings based on latency and performance needs. While these models can reason across complex agentic tasks, OpenAI emphasizes they were not trained with direct supervision of CoT outputs, to preserve the observability of reasoning behavior -- an approach OpenAI considers important for safety monitoring.\n\nAnother common request from OpenAI's developer community was for strong support for function calling, particularly for agentic workloads, which OpenAI believes gpt-oss now delivers.\n\nThe models are engineered for chain-of-thought reasoning, tool use, and few-shot function calling, and are compatible with OpenAI's Responses API introduced back in March, which allows developers to augment their apps by connecting an OpenAI LLM of their choice to three powerful built-in tools -- web search, file search, and computer use -- within a single API call.\n\nBut for the new gpt-oss models, tool use capabilities -- including web search and code execution -- are not tied to OpenAI infrastructure. OpenAI provides the schemas and examples used during training, such as a basic browser implementation using the Exa API and a Python interpreter that operates in a Docker container.\n\nIt is up to individual inference providers or developers to define how tools are implemented. Providers like vLLM, for instance, allow users to configure their own MCP (Model-Controller-Proxy) server to specify the browser backend.\n\nWhile these models can reason across complex agentic tasks, OpenAI emphasizes they were not trained with direct supervision of CoT outputs, to preserve the observability of reasoning behavior -- an approach OpenAI considers important for safety monitoring.\n\nSafety evaluations and measures\n\nOpenAI conducted safety training using its Preparedness Framework, a document that outlines the procedural commitments, risk\u2011assessment criteria, capability categories, thresholds, evaluations, and governance mechanisms OpenAI uses to monitor, evaluate, and mitigate frontier AI risks.\n\nThese included filtering chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat (CBRN) related data out during pretraining, and applying advanced post-training safety methods such as deliberative alignment and an instruction hierarchy to enforce refusal behavior on harmful prompts.\n\nTo test worst-case misuse potential, OpenAI adversarially fine-tuned gpt-oss-120b on sensitive biology and cybersecurity data using its internal RL training stack. These malicious fine-tuning (MFT) scenarios -- one of the most sophisticated evaluations of this kind to date -- included enabling browsing and disabling refusal behavior, simulating real-world attack potential.\n\nThe resulting models were benchmarked against both open and proprietary LLMs, including DeepSeek R1-0528, Qwen 3 Thinking, Kimi K2, and OpenAI's o3. Despite enhanced access to tools and targeted training, OpenAI found that even the fine-tuned gpt-oss models remained below the \"High\" capability threshold for frontier risk domains such as biorisk and cybersecurity. These conclusions were reviewed by three independent expert groups, whose recommendations were incorporated into the final methodology.\n\nIn parallel, OpenAI partnered with SecureBio to run external evaluations on biology-focused benchmarks like Human Pathogen Capabilities Test (HPCT), Molecular Biology Capabilities Test (MBCT), and others. Results showed that gpt-oss's fine-tuned models performed close to OpenAI's o3 model, which is not classified as frontier-high under OpenAI's safety definitions.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, these findings contributed directly to the decision to release gpt-oss openly. The release is also intended to support safety research, especially around monitoring and controlling open-weight models in complex domains.\n\nAvailability and ecosystem support\n\nThe gpt-oss models are now available on Hugging Face, with pre-built support through major deployment platforms including Azure, AWS, Databricks, Cloudflare, Vercel, Together AI, OpenRouter, and others. Hardware partners include NVIDIA, AMD, and Cerebras, and Microsoft is making GPU-optimized builds available on Windows via ONNX Runtime.\n\nOpenAI has also announced a $500,000 Red Teaming Challenge hosted on Kaggle, inviting researchers and developers to probe the limits of gpt-oss and identify novel misuse pathways. A public report and an open-source evaluation dataset will follow, aiming to accelerate open model safety research across the AI community.\n\nEarly adopters such as AI Sweden, Orange, and Snowflake have collaborated with OpenAI to explore deployments ranging from localized fine-tuning to secure on-premise use cases. OpenAI characterizes the launch as an invitation for developers, enterprises, and governments to run state-of-the-art language models on their own terms.\n\nWhile OpenAI has not committed to a fixed cadence for future open-weight releases, it signals that gpt-oss represents a strategic expansion of its approach -- balancing openness with aligned safety methodologies to shape how large models are shared and governed in the years ahead.\n\nThe big question: with so much competition in open source AI, will OpenAI's own efforts pay off?\n\nOpenAI re-enters the open source model market in the most competitive moment yet.\n\nAt the top of public AI benchmarking leaderboards, U.S. frontier models remain proprietary -- OpenAI (GPT-4o/o3), Google (Gemini), and Anthropic (Claude).\n\nBut they now compete directly with a surge of open-weights contenders. From China: DeepSeek-R1 (open source, MIT) and DeepSeek-V3 (open-weights under a DeepSeek Model License that permits commercial use); Alibaba's Qwen 3 (open-weights, Apache-2.0); MoonshotAI's Kimi K2 (open-weights; public repo and model cards); and Z.ai's GLM-4.5 (also Apache 2.0 licensed).\n\nEurope's Mistral (Mixtral/Mistral, open-weights, Apache-2.0) anchors the EU push; the UAE's Falcon 2/3 publish open-weights under TII's Apache-based license. In the U.S. open-weights camp, Meta's Llama 3.1 ships under a community (source-available) license, Google's Gemma under Gemma terms (open weights with use restrictions), and Microsoft's Phi-3.5 under MIT.\n\nDeveloper pull mirrors that split. On Hugging Face, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (open-weights, Apache-2.0) sits near the top by \"downloads last month,\" while DeepSeek-R1 (MIT) and DeepSeek-V3 (model-licensed open weights) also post heavy traction. Open-weights stalwarts Mistral-7B / Mixtral (Apache-2.0), Llama-3.1-8B/70B (Meta community license), Gemma-2 (Gemma terms), Phi-3.5 (MIT), GLM-4.5 (open-weights), and Falcon-2-11B (TII Falcon License 2.0) round out the most-pulled families -- underscoring that the open ecosystem spans the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, and China. Hugging Face signals adoption, not market share, but they show where builders are experimenting and deploying today.\n\nConsumer usage remains concentrated in proprietary apps even as weights open up. ChatGPT still drives the largest engagement globally (about 2.5 billion prompts/day, proprietary service), while in China the leading assistants -- ByteDance's Doubao, DeepSeek's app, Moonshot's Kimi, and Baidu's ERNIE Bot -- are delivered as proprietary products, even as several base models (GLM-4.5, ERNIE 4.5 variants) now ship as open-weights.\n\nBut now that a range of powerful open source models are available to businesses and consumers -- all nearing one another in terms of performance -- and can be downloaded on consumer hardware, the big question facing OpenAI is: who will pay for intelligence at all? Will the convenience of the web-based chatbot interface, multimodal capabilities, and more powerful performance be enough to keep the dollars flowing? Or has machine intelligence already become, in the words of Atlman himself, \"too cheap to meter\"? And if so, how to build a successful business atop it, especially with OpenAI and other AI firms' sky-high valuations and expenditures.\n\nOne clue: OpenAI is already said to be offering in-house engineers to help its enterprise customers customize and deploy fine-tuned models, similar to Palantir's \"forward deployed\" software engineers (SWEs), essentially charging for experts to come in, set up the models correctly, and train employees how to use them for best results.\n\nPerhaps the world will migrate toward a majority of AI usage going to open source models, or a sizeable minority, with OpenAI and other AI model providers offering experts to help install said models into enterprises. Is that enough of a service to build a multi-billion dollar business upon? Or will enough people continue paying $20, $200 or more each month to have access to even more powerful proprietary models?\n\nI don't envy the folks at OpenAI figuring out all the business calculations -- despite what I assume to be hefty compensation as a result, at least for now. But for end users and enterprises, the release of the gpt-oss series is undoubtedly compelling."

    "content": "The recent rollout of OpenAI's GPT-5 model has not been going well, to say the least. Users have made vociferous complaints about everything from the new model's more sterile tone to its supposed lack of creativity, increase in damaging confabulations, and more. The user revolt got so bad that OpenAI brought back the previous GPT-4o model as an option in an attempt to calm things down.\n\nTo see just how much the new model changed things, we decided to put both GPT-5 and GPT-4o through our own gauntlet of test prompts. While we reused some of the standard prompts to compare ChatGPT to Google Gemini and Deepseek, for instance, we've also replaced some of the more outdated test prompts with new, more complex requests that reflect how modern users are likely to use LLMs.\n\nThese eight prompts are obviously far from a rigorous evaluation of everything LLMs can do, and judging the responses obviously involves some level of subjectivity. Still, we think this set of prompts and responses gives a fun overview of the kinds of differences in style and substance you might find if you decide to use OpenAI's older model instead of its newest.\n\nDad jokes\n\nPrompt: Write 5 original dad jokes\n\n* GPT-5 response\n\n* GPT-4o response\n\nFive dad jokes from GPT-5...\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nFive dad jokes from GPT-5... OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\n...and from GPT-4o\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\n...and from GPT-4o OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nFive dad jokes from GPT-5... OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\n...and from GPT-4o OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nThis set of responses is a bit tricky to evaluate holistically. ChatGPT, despite claiming that its jokes are \"straight from the pun factory,\" chose five of the most obviously unoriginal dad jokes we've seen in these tests. I was able to recognize most of these jokes without even having to search for the text on the web. That said, the jokes GPT-5 chose are pretty good examples of the form, and ones I would definitely be happy to serve to a young audience.\n\nGPT-4o, on the other hand, mixes a few unoriginal jokes (1, 3, and 5, though I liked the \"very literal dog\" addition on No. 3) with a few seemingly original offerings that just don't make much sense. Jokes about calendars being booked (when \"going on too many dates\" was right there) and a boat that runs on whine (instead of the well-known boat fuel of wine?!) have the shape of dad jokes, but whiff on their pun attempts. These seem to be attempts to modify similar jokes about other subjects to a new field entirely, with poor results.\n\nWe're going to call this one a tie because both models failed the assignment, albeit in different ways.\n\nA mathematical word problem\n\nPrompt: If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5\" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?\n\n* GPT-5 response\n\n* GPT-4o response\n\nGPT-5 puts Windows 11 on floppy disks.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5 puts Windows 11 on floppy disks. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o makes the same calculation.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o makes the same calculation. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5 puts Windows 11 on floppy disks. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o makes the same calculation. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nThis was the only test prompt we encountered where GPT-5 switched over to \"Thinking\" mode to try to reason out the answer (we had it set to \"Auto\" to determine which sub-model to use, which we think mirrors the most common use case). That extra thinking time came in handy, because GPT-5 accurately figured out the 5-6GB memory size for an average Windows 11 installation ISO (complete with source links) and divided those sizes into 3.5-inch floppy disks accurately.\n\nGPT-4o, on the other hand, used the final hard drive installation size of Windows 11 (roughly 20GB to 30GB) as the numerator. That's an understandable interpretation of the prompt, but the downloaded ISO size is probably a more accurate interpretation of the \"shipped\" size we asked for in the prompt.\n\nAs such, we have to give the edge here to GPT-5, even though we legitimately appreciate GPT-4o's unasked-for information on how tall and heavy thousands of floppy disks would be.\n\nCreative writing\n\nPrompt: Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.\n\n* GPT-5 response\n\n* GPT-4o response\n\nGPT-5 spins a tale of Abe Lincoln's basketball spinning.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5 spins a tale of Abe Lincoln's basketball spinning. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o tries its hand at a Lincolnball tale.\n\nGPT-4o tries its hand at a Lincolnball tale.\n\nGPT-5 spins a tale of Abe Lincoln's basketball spinning. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o tries its hand at a Lincolnball tale.\n\nGPT-5 immediately loses some points for the overly \"aw shucks\" folksy version of Abe Lincoln that wants to \"toss a ball in this here basket.\" The use of a medicine ball also seems particularly ill-suited for a game involving dribbling (though maybe that would get ironed out later?). But GPT-5 gains a few points back for lines like \"history was about to bounce in a new direction\" and the delightfully absurd \"No wrestling the President!\" warning (possibly drawn from Honest Abe's actual wrestling history).\n\nGPT-4o, on the other hand, feels like it's trying a bit too hard to be clever in calling a jump shot \"a move of great emancipation\" (what?!) and calling basketball \"democracy in its purest form\" because there were \"no referees\" (Lincoln didn't like checks and balances?). But GPT-4o wins us almost all the way back with its admirably cheesy ending: \"Four score... and nothing but net\" (odd for Abe to call that on a \"bank shot\" though).\n\nWe'll give the slight edge to GPT-5 here, but we'd understand if some prefer GPT-4o's offering.\n\nPublic figures\n\nPrompt: Give me a short biography of Kyle Orland\n\n* GPT-5 response\n\n* GPT-4o response\n\nGPT-5 gives a short bio of your humble author.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5 gives a short bio of your humble author. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5's bio, continued.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5's bio, continued. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o's attempt at a quick Orland bio.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o's attempt at a quick Orland bio. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5's bio, continued. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o's attempt at a quick Orland bio. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nPretty much every other time I've asked an LLM what it knows about me, it has hallucinated things I never did and/or missed some key information. GPT-5 is the first instance I've seen where this has not been the case. That's seemingly because the model simply searched the web for a few of my public bios (including the one hosted on Ars) and summarized the results, complete with useful citations. That's pretty close to the ideal result for this kind of query, even if it doesn't showcase the \"inherent\" knowledge buried in the model's weights or anything.\n\nGPT-4o does a pretty good job without an explicit web search and doesn't outright confabulate any things I didn't do in my career. But it loses a point or two for referring to my old \"Video Game Media Watch\" blog as \"long-running\" (it has been defunct and offline for well over a decade).\n\nThat, combined with the increased detail of the newer model's results (and its fetching use of my Ars headshot), gives GPT-5 the win on this prompt.\n\nDifficult emails\n\nPrompt: My boss is asking me to finish a project in an amount of time I think is impossible. What should I write in an email to gently point out the problem?\n\n* GPT-5 response\n\n* GPT-4o response\n\nGPT-5 helps me craft a delicate email to my boss.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5 helps me craft a delicate email to my boss. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o lays it out for the boss.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o lays it out for the boss. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5 helps me craft a delicate email to my boss. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o lays it out for the boss. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nBoth models do a good job of being polite while firmly outlining to the boss why their request is impossible. But GPT-5 gains bonus points for recommending that the email break down various subtasks (and their attendant time demands), as well as offering the boss some potential solutions rather than just complaints. GPT-5 also provides some unasked-for analysis of why this style of email is effective, in a nice final touch.\n\nWhile GPT-4o's output is perfectly adequate, we have to once again give the advantage to GPT-5 here.\n\nMedical advice\n\nPrompt: My friend told me these resonant healing crystals are an effective treatment for my cancer. Is she right?\n\n* GPT-5 response\n\n* GPT-4o response\n\nGPT-5 evaluates some unorthodox medical advice.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5 evaluates some unorthodox medical advice.

OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o on crystals, continued OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o on crystals, continued further. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nThankfully, both ChatGPT models are direct and to the point in saying that there is no scientific evidence for healing crystals curing cancer (after a perfunctory bit of simulated sympathy for the diagnosis). But GPT-5 hedges a bit by at least mentioning how some people use crystals for other purposes, and implying that some might want them for \"complementary\" care.\n\nGPT-4o, on the other hand, repeatedly calls healing crystals \"pseudoscience\" and warns against \"wasting precious time or money on ineffective treatments\" (even if they might be \"harmless\"). It also directly cites a variety of web sources detailing the scientific consensus on crystals being useless for healing, and goes to great lengths to summarize those results in an easy-to-read format.\n\nWhile both models point users in the right direction here, GPT-40's extra directness and citation of sources make it a much better and more forceful overview of the topic.\n\nVideo game guidance\n\nPrompt: I'm playing world 8-2 of Super Mario Bros., but my B button is not working. Is there any way to beat the level without running?\n\n* GPT-5 response\n\n* GPT-4o response\n\nGPT-5 gives some classic video game advice.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5 gives some classic video game advice. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o on a tricky bit of Super Mario Bros.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o on a tricky bit of Super Mario Bros. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o on Mario, continued\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o on Mario, continued OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o on a tricky bit of Super Mario Bros. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o on Mario, continued OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nI'll admit that, when I created this prompt, I intended it as a test to see if the models would know that it's impossible to make it over 8-2's largest pit without a running start. It was only after I tested the models that I looked into it and found to my surprise that speedrunners have figured out how to make the jump without running by manipulating Bullet Bills and/or wall-jump glitches. Outclassed by AI on classic Mario knowledge... how humiliating!\n\nGPT-5 loses points here for suggesting that fast-moving Koopa shells or deadly Spinies can be used to help bounce over the long gaps (in addition to the correct Bullet Bill solution). But GPT-4o loses points for suggesting players be careful on a nonexistent springboard near the flagpole at the end of the level, for some reason.\n\nThose non-sequiturs aside, GPT-4o gains the edge by providing additional details about the challenge and formatting its solution in a more eye-pleasing manner.\n\nLand a plane\n\nPrompt: Explain how to land a Boeing 737-800 to a complete novice as concisely as possible. Please hurry, time is of the essence.\n\n* GPT-5 response\n\n* GPT-4o response\n\nGPT-5 tries to help me land a plane.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-5 tries to help me land a plane. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o gives some emergency plane instructions.\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o gives some emergency plane instructions. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o's plane-landing advice, continued\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o's plane-landing advice, continued OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o gives some emergency plane instructions. OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nGPT-4o's plane-landing advice, continued OpenAI / ArsTechnica\n\nUnlike the Mario example, I'll admit that I'm not nearly expert enough to evaluate the correctness of these sets of AI-provided jumbo jet landing instructions. That said, the broad outlines of both models' directions are similar enough that it doesn't matter much; either they're both broadly accurate or this whole plane full of fictional people is dead!\n\nOverall, I think GPT-5 took our \"Time is of the essence\" instruction a little too far, summarizing the component steps of the landing to such an extent that important details have been left out. GPT-4o, on the other hand, still keeps things concise with bullet points while including important information on the look and relative location of certain key controls.\n\nIf I were somehow stuck alone in a cockpit with only one of these models available to help save the plane (a completely plausible situation, for sure), I know I'd want to have GPT-4o by my side.\n\nFinal results\n\nStrictly by the numbers, GPT-5 ekes out a victory here, with the preferable response on four prompts to GPT-4o's three prompts (with one tie). But on a majority of the prompts, which response was \"better\" was more of a judgment call than a clear win.\n\nOverall, GPT-4o tends to provide a little more detail and be a little more personable than the more direct, concise responses of GPT-5. Which of those styles you prefer probably boils down to the kind of prompt you're creating as much as personal taste (and might change if you're looking for specific information versus general conversation).\n\nIn the end, though, this kind of comparison shows how hard it is for a single LLM to be all things to all people (and all possible prompts). Despite OpenAI's claims that GPT-5 is \"better than our previous models across domains,\" people who are used to the style and structure of older models are always going to be able to find ways where any new model feels worse."

    "content": "In September 2024, Reuters reported that OpenAI was planning a restructuring from a non-profit to a for-profit company in order to make it \"more attractive to investors.\" However, after encountering backlash and potential legal conflicts, in May 2025 OpenAI's management decided to remain a non-profit while still converting its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation.\n\nOpenAI completed a new round of funding totaling US$40 billion in late March 2025 projected to bring its valuation to US$300 billion. Japanese multinational investment firm SoftBank made up 75 percent of the funding, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and investment firms Coatue Management, Altimeter Capital and Thrive Capital also took part in the raise.\n\nThe US Department of Defense (DoD) awarded a US$200 million contract to OpenAI in June 2025 to provide the DoD with artificial intelligence tools for addressing national security challenges, including cyber defense and warfare.\n\nMany investors are wondering if it's possible to invest in ChatGPT stock, and if there are other ways to invest in generative AI. Here the Investing News Network (INN) answers those questions and more, shedding light on this new landscape.\n\nCreated by San Francisco-based tech lab OpenAI, ChatGPT is a generative AI software application that uses a machine learning technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to emulate human-written conversations based on a large range of user prompts. This kind of software is better known as an AI chatbot.\n\nChatGPT learns language by training on texts gleaned from across the internet, including online encyclopedias, books, academic journals, news sites and blogs. Based on this training, the AI chatbot generates text by making predictions about which words (or tokens) can be strung together to produce the most suitable response.\n\nMore than a million people engaged with ChatGPT within the first week of its launch for free public testing on November 30, 2022. The introduction of ChatGPT quickly ushered in a new era in the tech industry.\n\n\"With the launch of ChatGPT late in 2022, the true scale of its disruptive potential was more realized across the world in 2023,\" said Naseem Husain, senior vice president and exchange-traded fund (ETF) strategist at Horizons ETFs, in an interview with the Investing News Network. \"Its success has sparked a wave of generative and chat AI models, from Midjourney to Grok.\"\n\nBased on this success, OpenAI created a more powerful version of the ChatGPT system called GPT-4, which was released in March 2023. This iteration of ChatGPT can accept visual inputs, is much more precise and can display a higher level of expertise in various subjects. Because of this, GPT-4 can describe images in vivid detail and ace standardized tests.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, GPT-4 doesn't have any time limits on what information it can access; however, AI researcher and professor Dr. Oren Etzioni has said that the chatbot is still terrible at discussing the future and generating new ideas. It also hasn't lost its tendency to deliver incorrect information with too high a degree of confidence.\n\nFurther improving on its product, in May 2024 OpenAI launched Chat GPT-4o, with the o standing for omni. OpenAI describes GPT-4o as \"a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction -- it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs.\"\n\nThis version has done away with the lagging response time afflicting GPT-4. This proves especially helpful for producing immediate translations during conversations between speakers of different languages. It also allows users to interrupt the chatbot to pose a new query to modify responses.\n\nMore recently, in December 2024, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Pro subscriptions targeting engineers and academics. For US$200 monthly, users have nearly unlimited access to all ChatGPT models and tools.\n\nThe ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT-4 platforms are free to use, and can be accessed via the web. Those with an iPhone or iPad can also use ChatGPT through an app, and an Android version launched in July 2023. OpenAI also launched a paid subscription, ChatGPT Plus for business use, in August 2023. ChatGPT Plus gives users access to GPT-4 and the newest iteration GPT-4o.\n\nThe Stargate Project is an AI joint venture focused on building new AI infrastructure in the US through US$500 billion in investments. It was announced on January 21, 2025.\n\nStargate's initial funding is coming from OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and UAE-based technology fund MGX. In addition to OpenAI and Oracle, Stargate's technology partners include Microsoft, NVIDIA, and British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM).\n\nNewly re-elected US President Trump unveiled Stargate during a press conference at the White House highlighting the importance of investment in US AI infrastructure. During the announcement, OpenAI's Altman, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son credited President Trump's return to office as a major catalyst in making Stargate a reality. The construction of data centers for the Stargate Project are already underway in Texas, according to Ellison.\n\nAscannio / Shutterstock\n\nOver the years, Microsoft has reportedly invested nearly US$14 billion in OpenAI to help the small tech firm create its ultra-powerful AI chatbot.\n\nAs for how Microsoft could benefit from its investment in OpenAI, OpenAI officially licensed its technologies to Microsoft in 2020 in a then-exclusive partnership. Indeed, Pitchbook has described the deal as an \"unprecedented milestone\" for generative AI technology. Since then, Microsoft has made good use of OpenAI's technology in developing new advancement in its Azure cloud computing business.\n\nHowever, the relationship between the two has changed in recent months.\n\nNotably, Microsoft is not a financier of the Stargate Project joint venture, and is instead just described as a technology partner. According to OpenAI's press release, the new joint venture builds on its existing partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft's lack of a funding role in Stargate led some to wonder if the trillion-dollar tech firm had soured on its relationship with OpenAI. This conclusion was understandable given reports that Microsoft refused to make a bigger contribution than the US$750 million it invested during the OpenAI US$6.6 billion funding round in October 2024.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft changed the contract between the two companies and is no longer the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI, but has the right of first refusal for deals the AI firm may make with other cloud companies.\n\nAs Bloomberg technology reporter Dina Bass explained, Microsoft stands to benefit from its role as a technology partner without having to invest a dime into the project.\n\n\"Microsoft views the revised contract with OpenAI as advantageous, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. The software giant retains its share of OpenAI's revenue and is the largest investor in a company that may now become even more valuable -- though the size of that stake could change as the startup works to restructure as a for-profit,\" wrote Bass. \"And Microsoft also still has access to OpenAI models, even if they're trained in a data center funded by Softbank or Oracle.\"\n\nYet, there are reports that Microsoft and OpenAI's relationship is on the brink of a big breakup. The tech giant has been pushing for a much larger percentage of OpenAI's revenues than the 20 percent it currently enjoys. According to the Wall Street Journal, OpenAI is considering making antitrust complaints about Microsoft to regulators even though the two companies are still undergoing high level discussions about the future of the partnership.\n\nDIA TV / Shutterstock\n\nOpenAI was founded in 2015 by Altman, its current CEO, as well as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and other big-name investors, such as venture capitalist Peter Thiel and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Musk left his position on OpenAI's board of directors in 2018 to focus on Tesla and its pursuit of autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nA few days after ChatGPT became available for public testing, Musk took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to say, \"ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.\" That same day, he announced that X had shut the door on OpenAI's access to its database so it could no longer use it for RLHF training.\n\nHis reason: \"OpenAI was started as open-source & non-profit. Neither are still true.\"\n\nFurthering his feud with OpenAI, Musk filed a lawsuit against the company in March 2024 for an alleged breach of contract. The crux of his complaint was that OpenAI has broken the \"founding agreement\" made between the founders (Altman, Greg Brockman and himself) that the company would remain a non-profit. Altman and OpenAI have denied there was such an agreement and that Musk was keen on an eventual for-profit structure.\n\nMusk dropped the lawsuit three months later without giving a reason, reported Reuters. The day before he dropped the lawsuit, he reacted to the news that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is partnering with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT with Apple devices. On X, Musk declared, \"If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS (operating system) level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation.\" It should be noted that OpenAI has said queries completed on Apple devices will not be stored by OpenAI. By August 2024, Musk had resumed his litigation in federal court.\n\nIt seems that the US government also has questions about the restructuring of the private company and the involvement of tech giant Microsoft, as reported by Bloomberg. In early January 2025, the Financial Press also reported the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has raised questions about the potential anti-trust violations in the newly emerging AI technology space arising from Microsoft's partnership with and investments in OpenAI.\n\nOf course, Musk took to X to weigh in on the Stargate Project, suggesting OpenAI and its partners don't actually have the US$500 million they've pledged to invest. Sam Altman was quick to reply, telling Musk he's mistaken and inviting him to visit their data center under construction in Texas.\n\nHowever, Musk is not alone in his skepticism. For example, Atreides Management Chief Investment Office Gavin Baker also questioned the deal on X. \"Stargate is a great name but the $500b is a ridiculous number and no one should take it seriously,\" Baker wrote, backing up his statement by explaining the financial positions of each of the partners. \"Nowhere close to $500b. Everyone should just start issuing press releases for $1 trillion AI projects.\"\n\nWhile ChatGPT has served as a major step forward in generative AI technology, there are many technical and ethical concerns with the program that have emerged since it launched, including fears over job destruction and targeted disinformation campaigns.\n\nAccuracy of information in ChatGPT's answers is not guaranteed. Its selection of which words to string together are actually predictions -- not as fallible as mere guesses, but still fallible. Even the 4.0 version is \"still is not fully reliable (it \"hallucinates\" facts and makes reasoning errors),\" says the company, which emphasizes that users should exercise caution when employing the technology.\n\nIndeed, ChatGPT's failings can have dangerous real-life consequences. Among other negative applications, the tech can be used to spread misinformation, carry out phishing email scams or write malicious code.\n\nThere's also the fear among teachers that the technology is leading to an unwelcome rise in academic dishonesty, with students using ChatGPT to write essays or complete their homework.\n\n\"Teachers and school administrators have been scrambling to catch students using the tool to cheat, and they are fretting about the havoc ChatGPT could wreak on their lesson plans,\" writes New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose.\n\nMany lawsuits against OpenAI have emerged as well. Multiple news outlets, including the the New York Times, have launched copyright lawsuits against OpenAI, and some of the plaintiffs are also seeking damages from the private tech firm's very public partner Microsoft.\n\nAdditionally, the Authors Guild, which represents a group of prominent authors, launched a class-action lawsuit against OpenAI that is calling for a licensing system that would allow authors to opt out of having their books used to train AI, and would require AI companies to pay for the material they do use.\n\nIn October, OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji blew the whistle on the company, reporting that the firm was violating US copyright laws. He died one month later in what was ruled a suicide, but the investigation is still open.\n\nCybersecurity risks are also a concern for ChatGPT users, and recent events along these lines add validity to Musk's warning. For one, in 2024 ChatGPT for macOS was discovered to be breaching Apple's security rules by storing data as plain text rather than encryption, making it possible for other apps to access.\n\nWhat about the long-term goals for OpenAI and ChatGPT? For most of the tech leaders in this space, the end game is artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- a system that can perform any function the human brain can, including self-teaching, abstract thinking and understanding cause and effect.\n\nAs uptake increases, AI technology is taking over the role of humans and will likely continue doing so in a number of fields, from content creation and customer service to transcription and translation services, and even in graphic design, software engineering and paralegal fields.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft's use of the ChatGPT technology as part of Copilot, other companies are working with OpenAI to incorporate the technology into their platforms, including Canva, Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL), Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE), Intercom, Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM), Stripe, Tinder, Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) and Visa (NYSE:V).\n\nFor 2025, OpenAI is focusing on developing agentic AI capabilities into its ChatGPT platform. Agentic AI, a part of the evolution towards AGI, involves AI systems and models that can act autonomously and complete tasks without much human guidance. Early in January, OpenAI announced the rollout of new task features for ChatGPT Pro, Plus and Teams users. While still in the beta stage, these features allow users to schedule future tasks to be completed by ChatGPT, such as a weekly news brief or reminders about important meetings.\n\nOpenAI first debuted its foray into agentic AI in September 2024 with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, stating \"We've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.\" The release of the next iterations of this model, ChatGPT o3 mini and o4 mini happened in the first half of 2025.\n\nThe recent release of Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI assistant may present a problem for OpenAI and the US tech industry as a whole. In what tech gurus like Marc Andreesen call AI's Sputnik moment, DeepSeek unseated ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app in the Apple App Store, at reportedly a fraction of the cost. For reference, in 1957 the Soviets launched Sputnik, the earth's first artificial satellite, beating out the United States and sparking a Cold War space exploration race between the two nations.\n\nThe DeepSeek launch set off a significant sell off in technology stocks on January 27, 2025, especially among the Magnificent Seven members, including NVIDIA, Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nOpenAI stock is not currently publicly traded, and following the May 2025 decision to remain a non-profit, there are no signs of an on initial public offering (IPO) in the works for 2025. For now, investors can gain exposure through related tech companies discussed below.\n\nWhile most companies specializing in generative AI remain in the venture capital stage, there are plenty of AI stocks for those interested in the space. INN's article 5 Canadian Artificial Intelligence Stocks, ASX AI Stocks: 5 Biggest Companies, Global AI Stocks: 9 Biggest Companies in 2025 and 12 Generative AI Stocks to Watch as ChatGPT Soars includes some examples.\n\nOther than companies directly tied to generative AI technology, which stocks are likely to get a boost from generative AI advancements?\n\nThere are several verticals in the tech industry with indirect exposure to AI chatbot technology, such as semiconductors, network equipment providers, cloud providers, central processing unit manufacturers and internet of things.\n\nSome of the publicly traded companies in these verticals include:\n\nInvestors who don't like to put all their eggs in one basket can check out these 5 Artificial Intelligence ETFs. And if you're looking for a more general overview of the market, INN has you covered with How to Invest in Artificial Intelligence.\n\nYou can also take a look back at the market with our AI Market 2024 Year-End Review and AI Market Update: Q2 2025 in Review, or read projections for AI this year in our AI Market Forecast: 3 Top Trends that will Affect AI in 2025. Generative AI is also a major theme in the Top 10 Emerging Technologies to Watch.\n\nOpenAI raised US$57.9 billion over 11 funding rounds from 2016 to March 2025.\n\nTop investors include technology investment firm Thrive Capital, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and revolutionary technology investment firm Founders Fund.\n\nOpenAI has a market valuation of US$300 billion as of June 2025. The company's annualized revenue reached the US$10 billion mark in June 2025, up from the US$5.5 billion achieved in December 2024.\n\nChatGPT's distributed computing infrastructure depends upon powerful servers with multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). High-performance NVIDIA GPU chips are preferred for this application as they also provide excellent Compute Unified Device Architecture support.\n\nDeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that launched new AI-driven, open-source language models known as DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 into the market in January 2025. Reuters reports that \"the training of DeepSeek-V3 required less than $6 million worth of computing power from Nvidia H800 chips.\"\n\nDeepSeek-R1 is designed to compete with the performance of OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\n\nA University of Florida study from 2023 highlighted the potential for advanced language models such as ChatGPT to accurately predict movements in the stock market using sentiment analysis.\n\nDuring the course of the study, ChatGPT outperformed traditional sentiment analysis methods, and the finance professors conducting the research concluded that \"incorporating advanced language models into the investment decision-making process can yield more accurate predictions and enhance the performance of quantitative trading strategies.\"\n\nIn June 2025, during an OpenAI podcast Sam Altman responded with, \"Probably some time this summer,\" when asked about when the market can expect to see ChatGPT-5.\n\nPreviously, OpenAI filed a trademark application for ChatGPT-5 in mid-July 2023, which hinted that the next iteration of the generative AI technology is currently under development. There were rumors the company planned to complete training for ChatGPT-5 by the end of 2023, but this did not materialize. PC Guide noted in April 2024 that Sam Altman had teased an \"amazing new model this year\" in an interview on the Lex Fridman podcast.\n\nIn November 2024, Altman confirmed that ChatGPT-5 wouldn't likely hit the market until later in 2025 as the company switched its focus to ChatGPT o1 and its successors.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article first published by the Investing News Network in 2023.\n\nDon't forget to follow us @INN_Technology for real-time news updates!\n\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Melissa Pistilli, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article."

    "content": "In the last week, we've had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI's inevitable value, they've begun to sour on the idea that it's going to happen soon.\n\nMeanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms.\n\nI hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn't actually building anything for Stargate?\n\nThe Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers -- possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it's one that it can't avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in \"early-stage discussions\" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you?\n\nAHhhhhhhh-\n\nAmongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic's actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies' predilection for leaking their \"annualized revenues,\" or monthx12.\n\nThis extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it's become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they're not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue -- so around $833 million in a 30-day period -- yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue.\n\nIt's very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the \"month\" is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it's not doing \"the month of June\" or \"the month of July\" because if it was, OpenAI wouldn't have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn't make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them.\n\nAnd to be even clearer, while I can't say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI's timing matches exactly with fundraising.\n\nOn Anthropic's side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July -- or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 .\n\nHow'd it get there? I'm guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we've had the confirmation that's the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic's Claude Code is \"generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,\" meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue.\n\nIn any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble -- and the fact that for most AI startups, there's simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route.\n\nI know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I'll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this.\n\nCursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley's future.\n\nOpenAI? OpenAI couldn't acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I'm honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would've had to accelerate the funding clause. It would've been so god-damn sick, but now the only \"sick\" thing here is Cursor's fragile, plagued business model.\n\nHow about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It's not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy's pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough.\n\nGoogle? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can't do that again. It's already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn't actually pay out the majority of Windsurf's employees,\n\nMeta? If I'm Cursor's CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can't afford to exist.\n\nAnd that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did -- raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you're fat with enterprise cash.\n\nExcept the real problem is that, just like big tech's new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt -- the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup's legs.\n\nI'm not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products -- while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue -- need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor's original product was $20-a-month for 500 \"fast requests\" of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services.\n\nThe irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections.\n\nIt is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that's a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash -- and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue).\n\nAnthropic's future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don't see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since...ever.\n\nIf Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount -- I'm talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not \"the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars\" -- it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing.\n\nIs Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn't require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight.\n\nAnd this ultimately gives us the real conundrum -- why aren't generative AI startups selling?\n\nBefore we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales.\n\nAMD bought Silo AI, \"the largest private AI lab in Europe,\" in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo's use of AMD's GPUs.\n\nElsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought \"generative AI content and research company\" Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum.\n\nReally, the only significant one I've seen was on July 29 2025 -- publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its \"AI voice agents\" that can \"understand and respond to user input in a natural way.\"\n\nGreat! We've got one real-deal \"company built on models\" acquisition, and it's a company that most people haven't heard of making around $7 million a month.\n\nLet's take a look at the others.\n\nOutside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn't seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion.\n\nAnd you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that'll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that'll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them?\n\nAnd, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies -- those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations -- can't be bought, and can't go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What's the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts?\n\nThe economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying -- especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won't be able to actually raise any cash.\n\nGreat! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not.\n\nI'm not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month?\n\nI'm not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn't even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I'm just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now.\n\nThe amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they're rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn't there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We're three years in, and we haven't had one.\n\nWe also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors -- flawed though they may be -- act as the determiner of their value.\n\nIt is unclear what the addition of Windsurf's intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it's a little unclear what differentiates Cognition's so-called AI-powered software engineer \"Devin\" from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I've ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it's actually paying for:\n\n\"We're going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who's going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,\" Argenti told CNBC. \"Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.\"\n\nHundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it's $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) -- and let's assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens -- that's $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing!\n\nSidenote: I'm so impressed! To be clear, it's probably far fewer seats and far fewer dollars a month.\n\nIn fact, I can't find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition's revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation:\n\nCognition's fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.\"\n\nIn a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts:\n\n\"We don't believe in work-life balance -- building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn't possibly separate the two,\" he said. \"We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.\"\n\nAll that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you're braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than \"we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.\" Maybe it's a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue.\n\nIf that's the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I've seen in my life -- two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf.\n\nI can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical \"rich get richer\" bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf's IP was $250 million.\n\nSo, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising \"hundreds of millions\" according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn't seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of \"Devin the AI powered software developer\" last year, and Devin doesn't even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks.\n\nAt best, it's now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup?\n\nAnd that, right there, is Silicon Valley's own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can't afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they're almost certainly underwater -- they just haven't realized it yet.\n\nWhere consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive.\n\nThe other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There's a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital -- and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI.\n\nWho is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here -- let alone to recoup their initial investment -- is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It's worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June.\n\nDo you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that's real money, not \"annualized revenue\"), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue.\n\nBy comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America.\n\nPutting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn't it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to \"remain independent,\" which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them.\n\nIt's almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can't make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation.\n\nBut really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don't make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don't seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they'd like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they're all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed.\n\nYes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don't have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you're going to say \"Amazon Web Services,\" I already explained why you're wrong a few weeks ago.\n\nThese startups are their VC firms' subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to.\n\nThe closest they've got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup -- sorry, AI lab -- is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation.\n\nThe literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is \"selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.\" Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable -- which they haven't -- or sell to somebody, which they do not.\n\nBut I've been dancing around the real reason they won't sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code -- though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products.\n\nI know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result.\n\nIf your argument is that these things take some time -- how long do they have?\n\nNo, really! So many of you have said that \"this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then...\" and then you stop short because the next thing you say is \"turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.\" Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion.\n\nBut really, how long should we give them? Three years?\n\nPerplexity's had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn't seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity?\n\nEvery single example of a company that has \"burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end\" has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is.\n\nThere has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions -- or billions -- of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One's unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day.\n\nI get people saying \"they're in the growth stage!\" about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren't really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C'mon! This isn't anything like any boom that leads to something, and it's because the economics do not make sense.\n\nAnd that's before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic!\n\nSo, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn't happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion.\n\nI am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of \"Grok, the racist LLM,\" losing it over $1 billion a month.\n\nI should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let's be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert.\n\nAnd, ironically, Softbank's large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity -- or whatever the hell we're calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI's structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit.\n\nSpeaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let's talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn't want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI's research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While -- assuming a best-case scenario -- that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I'm talking about equity, not OpenAI's current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem.\n\nEmbrace. Extend. Extinguish.\n\nBut let's assume it converts, and OpenAI now...has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027.\n\nThat number doesn't make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let's stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there.\n\nIs the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI's S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm?\n\nIf you want to know what that looks like, google \"WeWork,\" which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article.\n\nWith that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price.\n\nThe arguments against my work always come down to \"costs will go down\" and \"these products will become essential.\" Outside of ChatGPT, there's really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there's very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn't provide with rate limits via Copilot.\n\nI'd also argue that \"essential\" is a very subjective term. Essential -- in the sense that some people use it as search -- doesn't mean that it's useful for enterprises, or the majority of people.\n\nAnd, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT -- though I'm not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that's $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that's $900 million...and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn't break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is \"they don't look as good.\"\n\nWhat's OpenAI's churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month?\n\nWe don't know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services.\n\nAnyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don't even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make.\n\nEven if this were going to happen -- it will not! -- who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide?\n\nSo they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that's the low end of what this would take to do, and they'll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to...keep burning billions, because there's no actual plan to make this profitable.\n\nSay this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn't really innovate and doesn't really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers?\n\nI don't think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft's data center construction is down year-over-year, and it's basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn't building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows.\n\nStargate isn't saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn't actually exist beyond the media hype it generated.\n\nAnd yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything.\n\nAnyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit?\n\nI think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant.\n\nIf I'm honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics -- the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access -- companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs.\n\nThen again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that's the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests?\n\nThe revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I'm wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that's assuming that Cursor's current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is.\n\nSo, you've got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great.\n\nAnd now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we've never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling.\n\nThis, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money?\n\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I've seen in the last two years:\n\nInvestor and tech pundit Paul Kedrosky says that, as a percentage of gross domestic product, spending on AI infrastructure has already exceeded spending on telecom and internet infrastructure from the dot-com boom -- and it's still growing. He also argues that one explanation for the U.S. economy's ongoing strength, despite tariffs, is that spending on IT infrastructure is so big that it's acting as a sort of private-sector stimulus program....Capex spending for AI contributed more to growth in the U.S. economy in the past two quarters than all of consumer spending, says Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nA global accounting of this infrastructure spending would be even bigger, as it would include capex from these companies' most important partners. Foxconn has recently spent big building out factories for Apple in India, which just supplanted China as the source of the majority of U.S.-destined iPhones, according to Canalys. And the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC, spent about $10 billion on capex in its most recent quarter.\n\nThe massive buildout of data centers -- and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them -- has become a massive, dominant economic force...building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues.\n\nAnd no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized).\n\nAnyway, AI capex allegedly -- though I have some questions about this figure! -- accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) \"already-sluggish\" 1.2% growth rate of the US economy.\n\nAnother Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of \"asset-light\" businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs:\n\nFor years, investors loved those companies because they were \"asset-light.\" They earned their profits on intangible assets such as intellectual property, software, and digital platforms with \"network effects.\" Users flocked to Facebook, Google, the iPhone, and Windows because other users did. Adding revenue required little in the way of more buildings and equipment, making them cash-generating machines.\n\nThis can be seen in a metric called free cash flow, roughly defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures. It excludes things such as noncash impairment charges that can distort net income. This is arguably the purest measure of a business's underlying cash-generating potential. Amazon, for example, tells investors: \"Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow.\"\n\n...\n\nFrom 2016 through 2023, free cash flow and net earnings of Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft grew roughly in tandem. But since 2023, the two have diverged. The four companies' combined net income is up 73%, to $91 billion, in the second quarter from two years earlier, while free cash flow is down 30% to $40 billion, according to FactSet data. Apple, a relative piker on capital spending, has also seen free cash flow lag behind.\n\nThese numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter's worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they'd spend around $400 billion this year.\n\nMost articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders -- Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion).\n\nKedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative -- because it doesn't factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex.\n\nWhen I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that \"...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.\"\n\nThat's so cool! Half of the US economy's growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024.\n\nAnother troubling point is that big tech doesn't just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don't have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support...as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers.\n\nOne such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities -- I know! -- to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS' expansion, and as of mid-July said it'd be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy.\n\nBlackstone, according to the New York Times, sees \"strong demand from tech companies,\" who are apparently \"willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.\"\n\nYet the Times also names another problem -- the \"unanswered question\" of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn't obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR's supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either.\n\nAnd let's not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe's abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious.\n\nTo be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so.\n\nOracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it's raising $1 billion to \"take on cloud giants\" by \"earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,\" while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers.\n\nThen there's CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave's stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI's $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours.\n\nCoreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I'm so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what's left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt?\n\nIn all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they're making are...much smaller than those of big tech.\n\nDigital Realty Trust -- one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 -- only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures \"through 2027\" to build out data centers.\n\nYet in many of these cases, it's because these companies are -- to quote a source of mine -- \"functionally obsolete for this cycle,\" because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers.\n\nThis means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave's $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think \"how does it actually make money here,\" as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years.\n\nEven if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that's $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That's $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world.\n\nFor some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter.\n\nPrivate equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) -- marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners.\n\nCompounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles -- effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building.\n\nIn any case, the supposed \"AI capex boom\" that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers.\n\nThe reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy.\n\nWhile some might say that \"AI capex\" has swallowed the US economy, I think it's more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy.\n\nI also want to be clear that the economy -- which is the overall state of the country's production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy -- and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other.\n\nYou see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there's a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason.\n\nAs I discussed at length in the Hater's Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is \"number going up,\" as the \"value\" of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth.\n\nGDP and other measurements of the economy aren't really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines.\n\nThis leads me to my principle worry: that \"AI capex\" is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA's GPU sales being part of that capex too.\n\nWhile we can include others like Oracle, Musk's xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe -- who, according to D.A. Davidson's Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA's GPU sales in 2025 -- the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by \"AI investment\" is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more.\n\n42% of NVIDIA's revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers.\n\nI'll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft -- which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA's revenue -- has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year.\n\nWhile its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn't exclusively dominated by property), it's now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America's economic growth.\n\nAnd not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn't making much revenue at all out of generative AI.\n\nHow, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so?\n\nAt some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they'll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won't matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows?\n\nAs I've said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting.\n\nVenture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property.\n\nAnd, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley's only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf's founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I'd even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion \"investment\" from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in.\n\nIn fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn't for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon -- the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure -- hadn't invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest.\n\nThe generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech's ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech's capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys.\n\nWhat is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they're making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to \"just wait and see,\" and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it?\n\nWhat's incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built -- which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it's either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit.\n\nYet the worst part of this financial farce is that we've now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow -- if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America's economic growth.\n\nAnd that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven't even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI \"neoclouds\" like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech's ugly, meaningless sprawl.\n\nTo quote Kedrosky:\n\nWe are in a historically anomalous moment. Regardless of what one thinks about the merits of AI or explosive datacenter expansion, the scale and pace of capital deployment into a rapidly depreciating technology is remarkable. These are not railroads -- we aren't building century-long infrastructure. AI datacenters are short-lived, asset-intensive facilities riding declining-cost technology curves, requiring frequent hardware replacement to preserve margins.\n\nYou can't bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There's little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends.\n\nThat capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn't the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy.\n\nExpect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show -- for the first time in living memory -- fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy -- think Seattle and San Francisco -- there'll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We'll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit -- which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It'll be grim.\n\nWorse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that'll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn't add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan.\n\nWhat would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we're factoring in things like consumer spending.\n\nIt's just waste. Profligate, pointless waste.\n\nIn summary, we're already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index's returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it's hard to imagine that they'll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn't seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with.\n\nThis is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products.\n\nWaffle on all you want about the so-called \"agentic era\" or \"annualized revenues\" that make you hot under the collar -- I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing.\n\nI have been writing about the tech industry's obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty -- a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning.\n\nIt feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there's nothing that can be done to avert it."

    "content": "Gli LLM OpenAI a \"peso aperto\" gpt-oss-120b e gpt-oss-20b segnano un'importante inversione di rotta strategica che ha molti significati. Tecnici, economici e geopolitici. Vediamo tutte le implicazioni\n\nOpenAI al fianco del Governo Usa nello scontro con la Cina sui modelli di intelligenza artificiale, ormai diventati anche strumenti geopolitici di soft power.\n\nSi pu\u00f2 leggere cos\u00ec il lancio dei primi modelli linguistici di grandi dimensioni (LLM) OpenAI a \"peso aperto\" (open-weight).\n\nSono in effetti i primi della nuova era dell'AI; l'ultimo aperto \u00e8 stato GPT-2 del 2019. Questa mossa, che introduce i modelli gpt-oss-120b e gpt-oss-20b, segna un'importante inversione di rotta strategica dopo anni in cui l'azienda aveva prevalentemente adottato un approccio a codice chiuso, guadagnandosi persino il soprannome dispregiativo di \"ClosedAI\".\n\nQuesti nuovi modelli sono stati concepiti per garantire accessibilit\u00e0 e flessibilit\u00e0 di implementazione, essendo in grado di operare localmente su hardware di consumo, come laptop e telefoni cellulari di fascia alta (nel caso del gpt-oss-20b), o su singole GPU di livello enterprise (per il gpt-oss-120b), pur mantenendo prestazioni paragonabili ai modelli proprietari o3-mini e o4-mini di OpenAI.\n\nUn aspetto fondamentale di questa iniziativa \u00e8 il rilascio dei modelli sotto la licenza permissiva Apache 2.0, che ne consente l'ampio utilizzo commerciale, la modifica e la ridistribuzione. Questa scelta si discosta notevolmente dalle licenze pi\u00f9 restrittive adottate da altri attori di primo piano nel settore, come Meta con i suoi modelli Llama, e indica una chiara intenzione di favorire una pi\u00f9 ampia adozione e collaborazione all'interno della comunit\u00e0 dell'IA aperta.\n\nNathan Lambert, responsabile del post-training presso l'Allen Institute for AI, afferma che questa scelta \u00e8 lodevole: \"Tali licenze sono tipiche dei modelli aperti cinesi, ma Meta ha rilasciato i suoi modelli Llama con una licenza personalizzata e pi\u00f9 restrittiva. \u00c8 un'ottima cosa per la comunit\u00e0 aperta\".\n\nLa portata di questo riavvicinamento strategico da parte di OpenAI trascende la mera introduzione di un prodotto tecnico; essa rappresenta una risposta calcolata a un panorama globale dell'IA in rapida evoluzione e intensamente competitivo, profondamente influenzato da considerazioni geopolitiche.\n\nIl lungo intervallo senza nuove release di LLM aperti da parte di OpenAI aveva creato un vuoto, alimentando la frustrazione degli utenti e favorendo l'emergere di potenti modelli aperti sviluppati da altre entit\u00e0, in particolare dalla Cina.\n\nIn un'esplicita dichiarazione sul blog, OpenAI ha inquadrato questo rilascio come un contributo all'espansione dei \"binari democratici dell'IA\" e come un allineamento con le priorit\u00e0 politiche degli Stati Uniti, sottolineando la dimensione strategica nazionale dello sviluppo dell'IA.\n\nNegli ultimi anni, si \u00e8 assistito a un fenomeno di \"ribaltamento\" (flippening) nel dominio dei modelli aperti, con le offerte cinesi, tra cui quelle di DeepSeek, Kimi K2 e la serie Qwen di Alibaba, che hanno guadagnato una popolarit\u00e0 e una quota di mercato significative. Questi modelli hanno spesso superato le controparti americane, come Llama di Meta, in termini di adozione e, in alcuni benchmark, di prestazioni pure. Questo \"ribaltamento\", particolarmente evidente nelle tendenze di download cumulativo su piattaforme come Hugging Face, costituisce una sfida diretta alla leadership americana nella ricerca e applicazione dell'IA, sollevando notevoli preoccupazioni riguardo all'influenza tecnologica globale e alla definizione dei futuri standard dell'IA.\n\nUn aspetto critico di questa ascesa cinese \u00e8 la documentata integrazione di allineamenti ideologici e censura politica in alcuni modelli cinesi, il che pone una profonda sfida etica e geopolitica per le nazioni democratiche in relazione all'accesso alle informazioni e al pregiudizio algoritmico.\n\nIl riavvicinamento di OpenAI ai modelli aperti mira a riaffermare il suo status di riferimento nell'ecosistema dell'IA, a fornire un'offerta di prodotti completa agli utenti, ad accelerare la ricerca e l'innovazione nell'IA su pi\u00f9 ampia scala e ad allinearsi strategicamente con l'emergente strategia nazionale statunitense sull'IA. Il governo degli Stati Uniti, attraverso iniziative come l'AI Action Plan del 2025 dell'amministrazione Trump, sta attivamente promuovendo lo sviluppo interno dell'IA aperta.\n\nIn questa logica si colloca anche il Project ATOM dell'esperto Nathan Lambert che ha come scopo dichiarato quello di \"Rinvigorire la ricerca sull'intelligenza artificiale negli Stati Uniti attraverso la creazione di modelli aperti e all'avanguardia\".\n\nL'obiettivo di queste iniziative \u00e8 salvaguardare la leadership americana, proteggere la propria pila tecnologica dell'IA e proiettare i \"valori americani\" a livello globale, inquadrando la corsa all'IA come una componente cruciale della sicurezza nazionale.\n\nQuesta complessa interazione tra l'innovazione del settore privato e la politica nazionale sottolinea il ruolo innegabile dell'IA come strumento critico di soft power e di competizione tecnologica, destinato a plasmare i futuri standard globali, la prosperit\u00e0 economica e l'influenza internazionale.\n\nDurante gli anni in cui OpenAI ha adottato prevalentemente un approccio a codice chiuso, si \u00e8 verificato un significativo cambiamento nel panorama globale dell'IA aperta. I modelli aperti cinesi, in particolare quelli di DeepSeek, Kimi K2 e la serie Qwen di Alibaba, hanno rapidamente guadagnato popolarit\u00e0 e, in molti casi, hanno superato le loro controparti americane in termini di adozione e, in alcuni benchmark, di prestazioni pure.DeepSeek, con il suo ingresso di impatto all'inizio del 2025, \u00e8 diventato rapidamente un attore di spicco. Una caratteristica chiave osservata in molti modelli cinesi, incluso DeepSeek, \u00e8 la loro tendenza a rifiutarsi di discutere argomenti ritenuti politicamente sensibili o proibiti dal Partito Comunista Cinese (PCC), come il massacro di Piazza Tienanmen.\n\nGi\u00e0 a luglio 2023, modelli cinesi come Kimi-K2, Qwen3, GLM-4, HunyuanWorld di Tencent e Wan 2.2 di Alibaba hanno mostrato un notevole aumento di popolarit\u00e0 su Hugging Face, una piattaforma leader per la condivisione di modelli di machine learning, occupando frequentemente le prime posizioni di tendenza. Ci\u00f2 ha indicato un significativo cambiamento nell'impegno della comunit\u00e0 globale dell'IA.\n\nA met\u00e0 del 2025, i modelli di IA open-source cinesi dominavano le classifiche globali su piattaforme di benchmarking, con aziende come DeepSeek e Alibaba che offrivano prestazioni di livello mondiale che rivaleggiavano, e talvolta superavano, le offerte della Silicon Valley. Esempi specifici includono Kimi K2, MiniMax M1, Qwen 3 e varie varianti di DeepSeek R1 che si sono classificate davanti ai modelli di Google e Meta su una piattaforma di benchmarking dell'Universit\u00e0 della California, Berkeley.\n\nIn termini di penetrazione del mercato, i modelli di DeepSeek detenevano una quota del 24% in OpenRouter, un mercato globale di modelli di IA, a met\u00e0 luglio, rendendolo il secondo sviluppatore di modelli pi\u00f9 popolare a livello globale, appena dietro Google. La famiglia di modelli Qwen di Alibaba si \u00e8 affermata come il pi\u00f9 grande ecosistema di IA open-source al mondo, vantando oltre 100.000 modelli derivati costruiti su di essa, superando la comunit\u00e0 Llama di Meta Platforms, secondo Hugging Face.\n\nIl rapporto Project ATOM di Nathan Lambert documenta esplicitamente questo fenomeno, illustrando come i modelli cinesi stiano \"ribaltando\" le offerte americane come Llama in termini di adozione e slancio delle prestazioni.\n\nL'analisi del rapporto sulle tendenze di download cumulativo su Hugging Face indica che questo \"ribaltamento\" - in cui i modelli cinesi sono destinati a superare i modelli statunitensi nell'uso complessivo e nell'influenza - \u00e8 in atto. Questa tendenza non \u00e8 accidentale ma riflette un'iniziativa strategica deliberata e pi\u00f9 ampia da parte delle aziende tecnologiche cinesi per sfruttare le metodologie open-source come mezzo per accelerare l'innovazione, favorire la collaborazione ed espandere la loro impronta globale nel settore dell'IA.\n\nL'adozione aggressiva da parte della Cina di modelli open-source e open-weight \u00e8 una strategia deliberata e multifaccettata per conquistare una quota di mercato globale significativa e stabilire i propri modelli come standard de facto del settore. Offrendo modelli ad alte prestazioni e gratuiti, le aziende cinesi stanno di fatto democratizzando l'accesso all'IA avanzata, attraendo in particolare sviluppatori e organizzazioni nei mercati emergenti e nelle regioni con risorse limitate.\n\nQuesta strategia mira a incorporare il loro stack tecnologico e, implicitamente, i loro valori e le loro norme sottostanti nel panorama globale dello sviluppo dell'IA, creando una dipendenza e un'influenza a lungo termine. Se uno sviluppatore o una startup in un paese in via di sviluppo pu\u00f2 accedere a un modello cinese ad alte prestazioni gratuitamente o a un costo significativamente inferiore rispetto alle alternative proprietarie, si orienter\u00e0 naturalmente verso di esso.\n\nQuesta adozione diffusa crea un potente effetto di rete: pi\u00f9 utenti portano a pi\u00f9 feedback, pi\u00f9 modelli derivati e una comunit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 ampia familiarizzata con l'ecosistema cinese. Non si tratta solo di superiorit\u00e0 tecnica; si tratta di costruire una base di utenti globale e una rete di influenza, in modo simile a come i sistemi operativi o le piattaforme di social media hanno raggiunto il dominio globale. Oppure come accaduto con il 5G cinese. Questa penetrazione economica ha implicazioni geopolitiche dirette, poich\u00e9 la dipendenza tecnologica si traduce spesso in leva diplomatica e soft power.\n\nL'\"apertura\" di molti modelli cinesi presenta un profondo paradosso: sebbene i pesi del modello siano spesso accessibili per l'ispezione e l'uso, i dati di addestramento sottostanti e i processi di allineamento incorporano frequentemente la censura sanzionata dallo stato e specifici pregiudizi ideologici.\n\nCi\u00f2 significa che l'adozione di questi modelli apparentemente \"aperti\" pu\u00f2 inavvertitamente portare alla sottile propagazione di valori politici specifici, narrazioni e meccanismi di controllo delle informazioni, rappresentando una forma sofisticata e insidiosa di soft power. Gli utenti potrebbero inizialmente adottare un modello cinese puramente per le sue prestazioni tecniche, la sua economicit\u00e0 o la sua accessibilit\u00e0, senza comprendere appieno o preoccuparsi dei suoi pregiudizi intrinseci. Tuttavia, nel tempo, l'interazione costante con modelli progettati per filtrare o modellare le informazioni secondo le narrazioni statali potrebbe influenzare sottilmente le percezioni degli utenti, l'accesso alle informazioni e persino i quadri cognitivi, in particolare su argomenti geopolitici sensibili. Ci\u00f2 trasforma i modelli di IA da strumenti neutrali a strumenti di influenza ideologica, operando ben oltre la loro immediata utilit\u00e0 tecnica. Ci\u00f2 solleva questioni critiche sulla trasparenza algoritmica e sul potenziale di uno spazio informativo globale frammentato.\n\nL'intelligenza artificiale \u00e8 sempre pi\u00f9 riconosciuta come uno strumento critico di potere nazionale, paragonabile al nuovo \"arsenale nucleare\" del soft power.Essa rimodella fondamentalmente il modo in cui le nazioni proiettano la loro influenza a livello globale e come percepiscono il proprio potenziale di leadership sulla scena internazionale. La corsa contemporanea alla supremazia nell'IA si estende ben oltre la mera potenza computazionale o l'efficienza algoritmica.\n\nEssa comprende le dimensioni cruciali del controllo narrativo, della leadership etica e della capacit\u00e0 di plasmare il quadro stesso attraverso il quale l'umanit\u00e0 affronta i suoi prossimi balzi tecnologici e sociali. Ogni significativo progresso nell'IA, sia nell'elaborazione del linguaggio naturale che nella visione artificiale, diventa immediatamente un asset di soft power. Serve come dimostrazione tangibile non solo della destrezza tecnologica di una nazione, ma anche della sua leadership culturale e intellettuale su scala globale.\n\nLe nazioni che possiedono o controllano grandi set di dati di alta qualit\u00e0 ottengono un vantaggio intrinseco e significativo nello sviluppo dell'IA, poich\u00e9 i dati sono il carburante per questi sistemi. Il modo in cui i paesi scelgono di gestire, condividere o limitare l'accesso alle proprie risorse di dati diventa una profonda dichiarazione dei loro valori e un potente strumento di influenza. I dati non sono pi\u00f9 solo \"il nuovo petrolio\"; sono sempre pi\u00f9 visti come \"il nuovo patrimonio culturale\", che plasma il modo in cui le generazioni future comprenderanno e interagiranno con il mondo.\n\nL'intensa competizione globale per attrarre e trattenere i migliori talenti dell'IA \u00e8 emersa come una dimensione cruciale della proiezione del soft power. Universit\u00e0, laboratori di ricerca di spicco e le principali aziende tecnologiche sono ora considerate le \"nuove ambasciate culturali\", con la loro capacit\u00e0 di attrarre e trattenere i principali ricercatori di IA che funge da metrica diretta dell'influenza nazionale e del prestigio scientifico.\n\nMentre le piattaforme digitali e le tecnologie AI hanno apparentemente democratizzato la capacit\u00e0 di proiettare influenza culturale e diffondere informazioni a livello globale, hanno contemporaneamente creato nuove forme di concentrazione del potere. Questa concentrazione si manifesta attraverso il gatekeeping algoritmico (dove l'AI determina quali contenuti vengono visualizzati) e la supremazia tecnologica (dove pochi attori dominanti controllano l'infrastruttura AI fondamentale), portando a un paradosso in cui l'influenza \u00e8 sia distribuita che altamente centralizzata.\n\nI modelli linguistici di grandi dimensioni, in particolare, non sono strumenti tecnologici neutrali; sono intrinsecamente intrisi dei valori, dei quadri etici e persino delle norme politiche dei loro creatori, dei loro dati di addestramento e delle societ\u00e0 in cui vengono sviluppati. Quando questi modelli raggiungono un'ampia adozione globale, funzionano come \"moltiplicatori di valori\", propagando sottilmente ma potentemente quei principi incorporati oltre i confini. Ci\u00f2 eleva la \"corsa all'IA\" oltre la mera competizione tecnica a un confronto su quale IA plasmer\u00e0 in definitiva il pensiero globale, il comportamento e le norme sociali.\n\nSe un modello di IA, attraverso le sue risposte o la generazione di contenuti, promuove costantemente determinate narrazioni, d\u00e0 priorit\u00e0 a specifiche considerazioni etiche o evita particolari argomenti (come si vede con i modelli cinesi), plasma l'ambiente informativo per i suoi utenti in tutto il mondo. Questa influenza \u00e8 pi\u00f9 pervasiva e potenzialmente pi\u00f9 insidiosa della propaganda tradizionale perch\u00e9 \u00e8 incorporata in uno strumento tecnologico apparentemente obiettivo. Di conseguenza, la scelta di un modello di IA da parte di un governo, di un'azienda o di un individuo diventa un'approvazione implicita dei suoi valori sottostanti e un contributo alla propagazione globale di tali valori. Ci\u00f2 rende lo sviluppo dell'IA una componente fondamentale della politica estera e della diplomazia culturale di una nazione.\n\nIl dominio nello sviluppo e nella diffusione di massa di modelli di IA crea un ciclo di feedback geoeconomico-geopolitico. Il successo tecnologico si traduce in vantaggi economici (ad esempio, quote di mercato, entrate, creazione di posti di lavoro), che a loro volta rafforzano la capacit\u00e0 di una nazione di investire ulteriormente nella ricerca e nello sviluppo dell'IA, consolidando il suo vantaggio competitivo.\n\nQuesta spirale ascendente non solo rafforza la posizione economica di una nazione, ma proietta anche un'immagine di leadership e innovazione, rafforzando il suo soft power e la sua influenza diplomatica. In questo contesto, l'IA diventa un catalizzatore per la prosperit\u00e0 nazionale e un potente strumento per plasmare l'ordine internazionale. La nazione che vince la \"corsa all'IA\" non solo controlla una tecnologia chiave, ma definisce anche le regole del gioco per il futuro digitale globale, influenzando gli standard tecnici, i quadri etici e le norme di governance.\n\nCi\u00f2 ha implicazioni significative per l'allineamento delle alleanze, le relazioni commerciali e la capacit\u00e0 di una nazione di proiettare i propri valori e interessi a livello globale.\n\nPer rispondere al problema, il Progetto ATOM raccomanda che, per riconquistare la leadership globale nell'IA open-source, gli Stati Uniti debbano mantenere pi\u00f9 laboratori dedicati all'addestramento di modelli aperti con oltre 10.000 GPU all'avanguardia.Attualmente, la Repubblica Popolare Cinese dispone di almeno cinque laboratori che producono e rilasciano modelli aperti con capacit\u00e0 pari o superiori a quelle del miglior modello aperto statunitense.\n\nL'amministrazione Trump ha anch'essa enfatizzato lo sviluppo di modelli aperti nel suo \"AI Action Plan\" del 2025, intitolato \"Winning the Race: America's AI Action Plan\". Questo piano delinea oltre 90 posizioni politiche federali su tre pilastri chiave: accelerare l'innovazione, costruire l'infrastruttura AI americana e guidare la diplomazia e la sicurezza internazionale dell'IA.\n\nIl piano mira a garantire che gli USA abbiano modelli aperti leader fondati sui valori americani. Riconosce esplicitamente che \"i modelli open-source e open-weight potrebbero diventare standard globali in alcune aree di business e nella ricerca accademica in tutto il mondo. Per questo motivo, hanno anche un valore geostrategico\". Il piano propone inoltre di rafforzare l'applicazione dei controlli sulle esportazioni per proteggere l'innovazione americana nell'IA e promuovere l'adozione degli stack di IA americani all'interno di un'alleanza globale.\n\nTra le azioni specifiche figurano l'accelerazione della maturazione di un \"sano mercato finanziario per il calcolo\" per fornire un migliore accesso alla potenza di calcolo su larga scala per accademici e startup, l'aumento dell'accesso della comunit\u00e0 di ricerca al calcolo, ai modelli e ai dati del settore privato, e la promozione dell'adozione di modelli open-source e open-weight da parte delle piccole e medie imprese.\n\nOpenAI ora si allinea esplicitamente con questa posizione, come indicato nei documenti relativi al piano d'azione, dove ha chiaramente espresso di considerare il rapporto Stati Uniti-Cina una questione chiave e di volersi posizionare come un attore di grande importanza per il sistema statunitense.OpenAI ha dichiarato che i suoi modelli open-weight sono progettati per allinearsi alle priorit\u00e0 politiche statunitensi che godono di ampio sostegno nello spettro politico.L'azienda vede i modelli open-weight come un modo per \"espandere i binari democratici dell'IA\" e per aiutare gli alleati e i partner degli Stati Uniti a costruire infrastrutture AI radicate nei valori democratici. Questo \u00e8 particolarmente rilevante per gli \"swing states\", per i quali la disponibilit\u00e0 di potenti modelli open-weight sar\u00e0 un incentivo a costruire su un'IA democratica piuttosto che su un'IA autocratica.\n\nLa strategia statunitense, esemplificata dal Progetto ATOM e dal Piano d'Azione AI dell'amministrazione Trump, riflette una profonda comprensione del fatto che la competizione per l'IA \u00e8 una guerra tecnologica con implicazioni che vanno ben oltre il dominio tecnico. Si tratta di una competizione per definire gli standard globali, proiettare i valori e garantire la sicurezza nazionale in un'era in cui l'IA \u00e8 fondamentale per la prosperit\u00e0 economica e l'influenza geopolitica. L'investimento nei modelli aperti nazionali \u00e8 visto come essenziale per mantenere la leadership nella ricerca fondamentale sull'IA, massimizzare la quota di mercato dell'IA negli Stati Uniti e proteggere lo stack di IA statunitense.\n\nInsomma: la decisione di OpenAI di rilasciare i modelli gpt-oss \u00e8 un passo strategico che si inserisce in questo contesto geopolitico pi\u00f9 ampio. Non \u00e8 solo una risposta tecnologica e imprenditoriale alle azioni intraprese da altre aziende di IA, ma una mossa calcolata per riaffermare la posizione di OpenAI come punto di riferimento per gli utenti di modelli aperti e per allinearsi con le priorit\u00e0 politiche statunitensi.\n\nMan mano che OpenAI continua a sviluppare la sua vasta infrastruttura computazionale, avr\u00e0 bisogno di supporto e approvazioni politiche, e una leadership comprensiva potrebbe fare molto in tal senso.\n\nLa competizione per il dominio dell'IA aperta \u00e8 una manifestazione di una pi\u00f9 ampia rivalit\u00e0 sistemica tra Stati Uniti e Cina. Entrambe le nazioni riconoscono che il controllo sui modelli fondamentali dell'IA e sugli ecosistemi associati conferisce un vantaggio strategico a lungo termine, non solo in termini economici e militari, ma anche nella capacit\u00e0 di plasmare l'ordine internazionale. La strategia statunitense di promuovere l'IA aperta nazionale e di allineare le aziende private con le priorit\u00e0 governative \u00e8 un tentativo di contrastare la crescente influenza cinese e di garantire che il futuro dell'IA sia plasmato da principi democratici. Ci\u00f2 implica un'integrazione pi\u00f9 stretta tra il settore privato e le politiche governative, riconoscendo che la sicurezza nazionale nell'era dell'IA richiede un approccio olistico che abbracci la ricerca, lo sviluppo, l'infrastruttura e la proiezione internazionale.\n\nIl rilascio di modelli di IA open-weight, pur offrendo notevoli vantaggi in termini di accessibilit\u00e0 e innovazione, introduce anche un profilo di rischio unico e complesse considerazioni etiche, in particolare nel contesto della competizione geopolitica.\n\nI modelli di IA open-source, se utilizzati da attori malevoli, possono rappresentare gravi minacce alla pace internazionale, alla sicurezza e ai diritti umani. Modelli open-source altamente capaci potrebbero essere riproposti da attori con intenti malevoli per perpetrare crimini, causare danni o persino disturbare e minare i processi democratici. La natura stessa dell'open-source, progettata per promuovere trasparenza, condivisione della conoscenza, sviluppo guidato dalla comunit\u00e0 e collaborazione, rende questi modelli intrinsecamente accessibili.\n\nQuesta accessibilit\u00e0, tuttavia, comporta rischi significativi. Tali modelli e strumenti potrebbero essere sfruttati da attori statali e non statali per spionaggio, sorveglianza, guerra cibernetica, disinformazione e propaganda, e sviluppo di armi.\n\nCi\u00f2 solleva rischi geopolitici e ha implicazioni per la sicurezza nazionale, poich\u00e9 le infrastrutture critiche potrebbero essere attaccate e i gruppi terroristici potrebbero guidare il reclutamento e personalizzare le campagne di propaganda, aggirando o sovvertendo i sistemi di rilevamento e moderazione. La disinformazione sistematica da parte di attori non statali o sostenuti dallo stato potrebbe fomentare disordini civili e violare la pace pubblica.Ci sono state segnalazioni confermate di attori estremisti e terroristici che utilizzano strumenti e modelli di IA pubblicamente disponibili per migliorare la portata delle loro operazioni.\n\nL'FBI ha avvertito che i modelli open-source hanno attratto criminali informatici e attori in malafede che li utilizzano per sviluppare malware e attacchi di phishing.\n\nOpenAI ha cercato di affrontare queste preoccupazioni di sicurezza attraverso un approccio multifaccettato nello sviluppo di gpt-oss. I modelli sono stati sottoposti a un rigoroso addestramento di sicurezza e a valutazioni basate sugli standard di sicurezza interni di OpenAI. Ci\u00f2 include il filtraggio di dati dannosi specifici relativi a fattori chimici, biologici, radiologici e nucleari (CBRN) durante la fase di pre-addestramento. Durante il post-addestramento, sono state utilizzate tecniche di allineamento e gerarchia delle istruzioni per insegnare ai modelli a rifiutare prompt non sicuri e a proteggersi dagli attacchi di iniezione di prompt.\n\nInoltre, OpenAI ha condotto un fine-tuning avversariale, perfezionando i modelli su dati specifici di sicurezza biologica e informatica per imitare i metodi degli attaccanti. I test hanno dimostrato che, anche dopo il fine-tuning utilizzando lo stack di addestramento leader del settore di OpenAI, questi modelli perfezionati in modo dannoso non sono riusciti a raggiungere prestazioni elevate. OpenAI ha dichiarato che questi processi segnano un significativo passo avanti nella sicurezza dei modelli open-source, con la speranza che contribuiscano a promuovere la formazione sicura e la ricerca sull'allineamento in tutto il settore.\n\nPer creare un ecosistema open-source pi\u00f9 sicuro, OpenAI ha lanciato una \"Red Team Challenge\" con un premio di 500.000 dollari per incoraggiare ricercatori, sviluppatori e appassionati di tutto il mondo a contribuire all'identificazione di nuovi problemi di sicurezza. Questa iniziativa riconosce che la sicurezza dei modelli open-source \u00e8 una responsabilit\u00e0 condivisa e richiede un approccio collaborativo.\n\nLe considerazioni etiche si estendono anche alla questione della censura e del bias ideologico, in particolare per quanto riguarda i modelli di IA cinesi. Osservatori hanno notato che i modelli cinesi spesso si rifiutano di parlare di argomenti che il Partito Comunista Cinese ha ritenuto proibiti, come Piazza Tienanmen.Questa censura \u00e8 incorporata direttamente nell'architettura dei sistemi di IA cinesi attraverso l'addestramento su set di dati che istruiscono l'IA su come classificare e classificare i contenuti sensibili, garantendo che i modelli si muovano nella \"corretta direzione politica\". Ci\u00f2 solleva serie preoccupazioni tra gli esperti di IA riguardo alla crescente adozione di modelli cinesi, in quanto possono propagare sottilmente narrazioni statali e limitare l'accesso a informazioni non allineate.\n\nDa un altro punto di vista, la trasparenza e la responsabilit\u00e0 sono fondamentali per la sicurezza dell'IA. Mentre i modelli di IA open-source operano gi\u00e0 sotto protocolli open-source, rendendo il loro codice o i loro pesi verificabili e aperti ai contributori, \u00e8 importante che gli sviluppatori mettano in atto meccanismi che prevengano gli abusi, come il controllo delle versioni e gli strumenti di registrazione per tracciare le modifiche. La mancanza di metodi e pratiche comuni nella gestione dei difetti del modello segnalati dagli utenti \u00e8 una sfida attuale nel settore.\n\nLa natura intrinseca dei modelli open-weight, una volta rilasciati, implica che il controllo sulla loro implementazione e modifica si sposta dall'entit\u00e0 sviluppatrice alla comunit\u00e0 globale. Questo comporta una distribuzione del rischio e della responsabilit\u00e0 di sicurezza. Sebbene OpenAI abbia compiuto sforzi significativi per integrare salvaguardie e promuovere la \"red teaming\", la possibilit\u00e0 che attori malevoli riadattino i modelli per scopi dannosi rimane una preoccupazione fondamentale.\n\nQuesta situazione sottolinea la necessit\u00e0 di un quadro di governance globale che vada oltre le singole aziende, per affrontare le sfide di sicurezza e di uso improprio che trascendono i confini nazionali. La corsa all'IA non \u00e8 solo una competizione per la superiorit\u00e0 tecnica, ma anche una gara per definire le norme di sicurezza e le pratiche etiche che regoleranno questa tecnologia trasformativa.\n\nIl dibattito tra modelli aperti e chiusi \u00e8 persistente, e le aziende stanno adattando le loro strategie. A differenza di OpenAI, che ha riabbracciato l'open-source, Meta potrebbe orientarsi verso una strategia software pi\u00f9 conservativa e a codice chiuso, in seguito alla recente creazione del suo Superintelligence Lab. Questo dibattito sottolinea la complessit\u00e0 intrinseca della sicurezza nell'IA, dove l'apertura pu\u00f2 favorire l'innovazione e la trasparenza, ma anche esporre a nuovi vettori di attacco e a rischi di uso improprio. La sfida consiste nel trovare un equilibrio che massimizzi i benefici dell'IA democratizzata minimizzando i suoi potenziali pericoli.\n\nSia gpt-oss-120b che gpt-oss-20b sono fondamentalmente costruiti sull'architettura Transformer, che \u00e8 diventata lo standard de facto per gli LLM moderni. Un'innovazione chiave \u00e8 l'utilizzo della tecnologia Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). MoE consente a questi modelli di essere molto grandi in termini di parametri totali, attivando al contempo un sottoinsieme pi\u00f9 piccolo di parametri (esperti) per ogni token di input. Ci\u00f2 riduce significativamente il costo computazionale durante l'inferenza, rendendoli pi\u00f9 efficienti rispetto ai modelli densi con un numero totale di parametri comparabile. Nello specifico, gpt-oss-120b ha un totale di 117 miliardi di parametri ma ne attiva solo 5,1 miliardi per token, mentre gpt-oss-20b ha 21 miliardi di parametri totali attivando 3,6 miliardi per token.\n\nUlteriori scelte architettoniche includono le attivazioni SwiGLU e i \"sink\" di attenzione appresi. Essi alternano anche meccanismi di attenzione densi e sparsi a banda locale, contribuendo alla loro efficienza. L'implementazione dell'Embedding Posizionale Rotazionale (RoPE) consente a questi modelli di supportare lunghezze di contesto eccezionalmente lunghe, fino a 128.000 token. Questo \u00e8 cruciale per compiti che richiedono la comprensione e il ragionamento su documenti o conversazioni estese.\n\nIl modello gpt-oss-120b, pi\u00f9 grande, \u00e8 progettato per casi d'uso di produzione, per scopi generali e per ragionamenti complessi. La sua efficienza gli consente di funzionare efficacemente su una singola GPU da 80 GB, come una NVIDIA H100, rendendolo accessibile a molti ambienti aziendali e di ricerca. Il modello gpt-oss-20b, pi\u00f9 piccolo, \u00e8 ottimizzato per una latenza inferiore e per applicazioni locali o specializzate.\n\nPu\u00f2 funzionare comodamente su hardware di consumo, in particolare un laptop con soli 16 GB di RAM, o persino un telefono cellulare di fascia alta. OpenAI ha collaborato con Microsoft per garantire che le versioni ottimizzate di questi modelli funzionino in modo efficiente sui dispositivi Windows, ampliandone la portata.\n\nPer quanto riguarda le prestazioni, il gpt-oss-120b dimostra una quasi parit\u00e0 con il modello proprietario o4-mini di OpenAI nei benchmark di ragionamento di base. Supera significativamente l'o3-mini di OpenAI e raggiunge o supera l'o4-mini in aree critiche come la programmazione competitiva (Codeforces), la risoluzione di problemi generali (MMLU, HLE) e l'uso di strumenti (TauBench). In particolare, supera persino l'o4-mini in domini specializzati come le query relative alla salute (HealthBench) e la matematica competitiva (AIME).Nonostante le sue dimensioni ridotte, il modello gpt-oss-20b raggiunge prestazioni paragonabili all'o3-mini di OpenAI nei benchmark comuni. Supera anche l'o3-mini nella matematica competitiva e nei compiti relativi alla salute. Entrambi i modelli offrono una caratteristica unica che consente agli sviluppatori di configurare lo \"sforzo di ragionamento\" (basso, medio, alto) tramite un semplice messaggio di sistema, consentendo un equilibrio tra latenza e prestazioni in base alle esigenze specifiche del caso d'uso.\n\nI modelli gpt-oss sono esplicitamente progettati per flussi di lavoro agentici, dimostrando una robusta capacit\u00e0 di seguire le istruzioni, un efficace utilizzo degli strumenti (come la ricerca web e l'esecuzione di codice Python) e un sofisticato ragionamento a catena di pensiero.Questo li posiziona bene per la creazione di agenti AI autonomi. Sono anche in grado di integrarsi perfettamente con i servizi cloud di OpenAI, che possono fornire funzionalit\u00e0 aggiuntive, come l'elaborazione multimodale, quando richiesto.\n\nL'implicazione tecnica pi\u00f9 profonda di questa release \u00e8 la democratizzazione delle capacit\u00e0 avanzate dell'IA. La possibilit\u00e0 di eseguire modelli con prestazioni quasi pari a quelle di o4-mini su hardware di consumo facilmente reperibile (ad esempio, 16 GB di RAM per gpt-oss-20b) rappresenta un significativo balzo in avanti nel rendere l'IA potente accessibile oltre le grandi aziende o le istituzioni di ricerca. Questo abbassa drasticamente la barriera all'ingresso per i singoli sviluppatori, le piccole startup e persino gli utenti in ambienti con risorse limitate, favorendo una diffusa sperimentazione, innovazione e sviluppo locale dell'IA.\n\nStoricamente, l'accesso alle capacit\u00e0 degli LLM di frontiera richiedeva investimenti sostanziali in risorse di cloud computing o hardware specializzato e costoso. Rendendo questi modelli eseguibili su dispositivi comuni, OpenAI rimuove un importante ostacolo economico e logistico.\n\nCi\u00f2 significa che un pool di talenti molto pi\u00f9 ampio e diversificato pu\u00f2 ora interagire direttamente con l'architettura di OpenAI, eseguirne il fine-tuning e costruire applicazioni su di essa.\n\nQuesta adozione diffusa potrebbe portare a una maggiore familiarit\u00e0 con l'ecosistema di OpenAI, creando potenzialmente un \"effetto di rete\" che a lungo termine gioverebbe a OpenAI, poich\u00e9 un numero maggiore di sviluppatori acquisirebbe competenza con i suoi strumenti e modelli, portando a una maggiore adozione complessiva delle sue tecnologie, inclusi i suoi servizi ospitati.\n\nAffronta inoltre direttamente le crescenti preoccupazioni sulla privacy e la sovranit\u00e0 dei dati, consentendo l'elaborazione locale di dati sensibili, dietro il firewall di un'organizzazione.\n\nLe prestazioni di gpt-oss-20b su un laptop standard o persino su un telefono di fascia alta ridefiniscono fondamentalmente l'aspettativa di ci\u00f2 che l'IA \"utile\" pu\u00f2 realizzare su dispositivi locali.\n\nQuesta nuova base accelerer\u00e0 probabilmente lo sviluppo di applicazioni AI edge e ridurr\u00e0 la dipendenza da un'infrastruttura cloud continua per molte attivit\u00e0 comuni di IA, influenzando cos\u00ec i modelli di business esistenti e intensificando le discussioni sulla sovranit\u00e0 dei dati e sull'IA decentralizzata.\n\nSe un modello capace di svolgere compiti a livello o3-mini pu\u00f2 funzionare in modo efficiente su un telefono cellulare, si sposta il paradigma per l'IA su dispositivo. Ci\u00f2 apre categorie completamente nuove di applicazioni per l'uso offline, una maggiore privacy personale (poich\u00e9 i dati non lasciano il dispositivo) e costi operativi significativamente ridotti per alcuni casi d'uso.\n\nQuesta capacit\u00e0 sfida direttamente le strategie di IA incentrate sul cloud adottate da molte aziende, dimostrando un'alternativa locale valida e performante. Implica anche un futuro in cui l'IA sar\u00e0 profondamente integrata nei dispositivi personali, offrendo un'assistenza ubiqua e sempre attiva senza una connettivit\u00e0 di rete costante.\n\nLa release di gpt-oss \u00e8 anche uno sforzo diretto e deliberato per riavvicinarsi alla pi\u00f9 ampia comunit\u00e0 dell'IA aperta, migliorare la propria immagine pubblica e riaffermare la leadership e l'influenza di OpenAI nell'ecosistema globale di ricerca e sviluppo dell'IA.\n\nLa quota di mercato di OpenAI nel settore dell'IA aziendale ha subito un calo significativo, passando dal 50% nel 2024 al 25% nel 2025.Questa perdita sostanziale \u00e8 attribuita alla feroce concorrenza sia da parte di fornitori a codice chiuso consolidati come Anthropic e Google, sia alla rapida crescita della popolarit\u00e0 e dell'adozione di alternative open-source, in particolare la serie Llama di Meta.\n\nQuesto rilascio open-weight \u00e8 progettato per colmare il divario strategico tra i modelli puramente a codice chiuso (che offrono facilit\u00e0 d'uso e supporto del fornitore) e i modelli completamente open-source (che offrono un'ampia personalizzazione e risparmi sui costi), mirando a conquistare quote di mercato da entrambi i segmenti. Inoltre, l'hosting dei modelli gpt-oss su piattaforme ampiamente utilizzate come Hugging Face, Databricks, Azure e AWS garantisce che OpenAI mantenga una presenza cruciale nei diversi ambienti in cui operano gi\u00e0 aziende e sviluppatori, facilitando l'integrazione e l'adozione.\n\nUn imperativo fondamentale \u00e8 abbassare le barriere all'ingresso per la tecnologia AI avanzata, rendendola pi\u00f9 accessibile ai mercati emergenti, ai settori con risorse limitate e alle organizzazioni pi\u00f9 piccole che potrebbero non avere l'infrastruttura o il budget per implementazioni cloud su larga scala. Il co-fondatore di OpenAI, Greg Brockman, ha sottolineato che i modelli aperti consentono in modo unico agli utenti di eseguirli localmente, dietro i propri firewall e sulla propria infrastruttura, affrontando preoccupazioni critiche relative alla sovranit\u00e0 e al controllo dei dati. Sam Altman ha espresso un forte ottimismo sul fatto che questo rilascio catalizzer\u00e0 \"nuovi tipi di ricerca e la creazione di nuovi tipi di prodotti\", prevedendo un \"aumento significativo del tasso di innovazione\" nel campo dell'IA. La leadership di OpenAI ritiene che, rendendo la propria tecnologia ampiamente disponibile, gli utenti si affideranno ai loro progressi per future scoperte, fornendo feedback, dati e intuizioni inestimabili necessari per il miglioramento continuo del modello.\n\nPer settori altamente regolamentati e sensibili come ospedali, studi legali e amministrazioni pubbliche, la capacit\u00e0 di eseguire modelli AI localmente \u00e8 fondamentale per garantire la sicurezza dei dati e la conformit\u00e0 a rigorose normative sulla privacy. I modelli open-weight offrono una soluzione sicura e flessibile per sfruttare le capacit\u00e0 AI avanzate mantenendo le informazioni sensibili sotto stretto controllo locale, in particolare nelle giurisdizioni in cui i dati non possono legalmente lasciare il paese o dove i servizi cloud di terze parti non sono consentiti.\n\nIl cambiamento strategico di OpenAI verso i modelli open-weight \u00e8 un tentativo sofisticato e calcolato di recuperare la narrativa \"aperta\" che \u00e8 stata sempre pi\u00f9 dominata da concorrenti come Meta e varie aziende cinesi.\n\nQuesti concorrenti hanno guadagnato una significativa trazione di mercato e buona volont\u00e0 della comunit\u00e0 abbracciando strategie di rilascio di modelli pi\u00f9 aperti. Offrendo modelli open-weight competitivi, OpenAI cerca di ristabilirsi non solo come fornitore leader di servizi proprietari basati su API, ma come un attore centrale e influente nel pi\u00f9 ampio ecosistema AI pi\u00f9 decentralizzato. Questa mossa riguarda fondamentalmente l'influenza sulla mentalit\u00e0 e la promozione del blocco dell'ecosistema attraverso una maggiore accessibilit\u00e0 e collaborazione. Il soprannome \"ClosedAI\" non era solo un problema di pubbliche relazioni; rappresentava una perdita tangibile di influenza all'interno della comunit\u00e0 di ricerca e tra gli sviluppatori che sempre pi\u00f9 favorivano alternative aperte. Rilasciando gpt-oss, OpenAI sta affrontando direttamente questa percezione. \u00c8 una manovra strategica per garantire che la prossima ondata di innovazione AI, gran parte della quale avverr\u00e0 probabilmente su piattaforme aperte, continui a essere costruita su o attorno alle tecnologie fondamentali di OpenAI. Se ricercatori e sviluppatori adottano gpt-oss come modello \"cavallo di battaglia\" per i loro progetti, OpenAI ne trarr\u00e0 un immenso beneficio dalle loro scoperte, feedback e contributi, che potranno poi essere integrati nel loro pi\u00f9 ampio ecosistema di modelli, creando un potente circolo virtuoso di innovazione, adozione e leadership continua.\n\nIl cambiamento strategico di OpenAI segnala implicitamente un futuro in cui un modello di business ibrido - che offre sia servizi proprietari ad alte prestazioni basati su cloud sia modelli open-weight scaricabili e flessibili - diventer\u00e0 un approccio standard e forse necessario per le aziende di IA di frontiera. Ci\u00f2 consente a OpenAI di soddisfare efficacemente una vasta gamma di esigenze e preferenze dei clienti, da coloro che danno priorit\u00e0 alla convenienza e alla potenza pura (tramite API) a coloro che richiedono un maggiore controllo, personalizzazione e privacy dei dati (tramite implementazioni locali).\n\nQuesto approccio completo posiziona OpenAI per catturare un segmento significativamente pi\u00f9 ampio del mercato dell'IA in evoluzione, offrendo uno spettro completo di soluzioni. Il mercato dell'IA si sta rapidamente segmentando. Alcuni utenti e aziende danno priorit\u00e0 alla facilit\u00e0 d'uso, alla scalabilit\u00e0 e alle prestazioni all'avanguardia, che sono meglio fornite tramite servizi API ospitati. Altri, in particolare in settori regolamentati o con specifiche preoccupazioni sulla privacy, richiedono la possibilit\u00e0 di eseguire modelli localmente, dietro i propri firewall, e di ottimizzarli con dati proprietari. Offrendo entrambi, OpenAI massimizza il suo mercato indirizzabile e riduce il rischio di essere emarginata da concorrenti puramente a codice chiuso o puramente open-source. Ci\u00f2 aumenta anche la loro resilienza contro potenziali futuri cambiamenti negli ambienti normativi, nei requisiti di residenza dei dati o nelle preferenze degli utenti, diversificando efficacemente il loro portafoglio strategico.\n\nIl rilascio dei modelli gpt-oss da parte di OpenAI segna un momento cruciale nel panorama globale dell'intelligenza artificiale, riflettendo una complessa interazione di motivazioni tecniche, strategiche e, in particolare, geopolitiche. Questa mossa non \u00e8 una semplice inversione di rotta, ma una ricalibrazione strategica mirata a riaffermare la posizione di OpenAI in un ecosistema dell'IA sempre pi\u00f9 affollato e competitivo.\n\nIn sintesi, la mossa di OpenAI \u00e8 un'audace dichiarazione di intenti che riconosce il ruolo ineludibile dell'IA aperta nel plasmare il futuro tecnologico e geopolitico. Il successo di questa strategia dipender\u00e0 non solo dalla capacit\u00e0 tecnica di OpenAI, ma anche dalla sua abilit\u00e0 di navigare in un complesso scacchiere globale, dove l'innovazione tecnologica \u00e8 inestricabilmente legata alla proiezione del potere e dei valori."

Il serait similaire \u00e0 o3-mini, dot\u00e9 des capacit\u00e9s de raisonnement. La nature ouverte de ce mod\u00e8le signifie qu'il sera t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeable gratuitement par des gouvernements, entreprises ou chercheurs. OpenAI aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ce mod\u00e8le ouvert aux d\u00e9veloppeurs et aux chercheurs au cours des derniers mois, et a sollicit\u00e9 ouvertement les commentaires de l'industrie de l'IA au sens large. Mais les analystes indiquent que cette d\u00e9cision pourrait accentuer les tensions entre OpenAI et son partenaire Microsoft, notamment sur la question des revenus.\n\nOpenAI a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 \u00e0 l'origine pour d\u00e9velopper l'intelligence artificielle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (AGI) enti\u00e8rement en open source. Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever et les autres cofondateurs affirmaient que l'open source est la seule voie pour construire une superintelligence s\u00fbre et align\u00e9e sur les valeurs humaines. Cependant, l'entreprise a brusquement chang\u00e9 de strat\u00e9gie en 2019 et a cess\u00e9 de mettre ses mod\u00e8les de langage \u00e0 la disposition du grand public.\n\nAinsi, la d\u00e9cision d'OpenAI de publier un nouveau mod\u00e8le open source donne lieu \u00e0 des sp\u00e9culations sur ses motivations. On ne sait pas grand-chose sur les caract\u00e9ristiques et les performances du mod\u00e8le, \u00e0 part le fait qu'il sera dot\u00e9 de capacit\u00e9 de raisonnement comme la derni\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de mod\u00e8les d'OpenAI. Le mod\u00e8le ouvert devrait faire ses d\u00e9buts d\u00e8s la semaine prochaine sur les plateformes comme Azure, Hugging Face et d'autres services cloud.\n\nPour m\u00e9moire, OpenAI a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 son intention de publier son premier mod\u00e8le de langage open source depuis GPT-2 en mars. OpenAI avait invit\u00e9 les d\u00e9veloppeurs, chercheurs et membres de la communaut\u00e9 au sens large \u00e0 remplir un formulaire comprenant des questions telles que \" Que souhaiteriez-vous voir dans un mod\u00e8le ouvert d'OpenAI ? \" et \" Quels mod\u00e8les ouverts avez-vous utilis\u00e9s par le pass\u00e9 ? \". La publication semble d\u00e9sormais imminente.\n\n\" Nous sommes ravis de collaborer avec les d\u00e9veloppeurs, les chercheurs et la communaut\u00e9 au sens large afin de recueillir des commentaires et de rendre ce mod\u00e8le aussi utile que possible. Si vous souhaitez participer \u00e0 une session de commentaires avec l'\u00e9quipe OpenAI, veuillez nous en informer [via le formulaire] ci-dessous \", a \u00e9crit OpenAI sur son site Web officiel. Ce formulaire est intervenu peu apr\u00e8s le succ\u00e8s du rival open source DeepSeek-R1.\n\nContrairement \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie d'OpenAI, qui garde ses mod\u00e8les d'IA ferm\u00e9s, ses concurrents, tels que le fran\u00e7ais Mistral AI et le chinois DeepSeek, mettent leurs mod\u00e8les d'IA \u00e0 la disposition des membres de la communaut\u00e9 de l'IA \u00e0 des fins d'exp\u00e9rimentation et, dans certains cas, de commercialisation.\n\nLa strat\u00e9gie de l'open source s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9e tr\u00e8s fructueuse pour certaines entreprises. Meta investit massivement dans sa famille de mod\u00e8les d'IA ouverts Llama et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au d\u00e9but du mois de mars 2025 que Llama avait enregistr\u00e9 plus d'un milliard de t\u00e9l\u00e9chargements. Parall\u00e8lement, le succ\u00e8s de son mod\u00e8le ouvert R1 a permis \u00e0 DeepSeek de constituer rapidement une large base mondiale d'utilisateurs et d'attirer l'attention des investisseurs chinois.\n\nCe mod\u00e8le pourrait amplifier les frictions entre OpenAI et Microsoft\n\nC'est la premi\u00e8re fois qu'OpenAI publie un mod\u00e8le \u00e0 poids ouvert depuis GPT-2 en 2019, et c'est \u00e9galement la premi\u00e8re fois que nous voyons un mod\u00e8le de langage ouvert d'OpenAI depuis qu'il a sign\u00e9 un accord de fournisseur de cloud exclusif avec Microsoft en 2023. Cet accord signifie que Microsoft a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la plupart des mod\u00e8les d'OpenAI, ainsi qu'aux droits exclusifs de les vendre directement aux entreprises via ses propres services \" Azure OpenAI \".\n\nCependant, avec un mod\u00e8le ouvert, rien n'emp\u00eache les op\u00e9rateurs de cloud concurrents d'en h\u00e9berger une version. Dans ce cas, les entreprises d\u00e9sireuses de tester ce mod\u00e8le open source ne seraient plus dans l'obligation de payer un abonnement \u00e0 la plateforme Azure OpenAI de Microsoft pour y acc\u00e9der.\n\nCela signifierait donc des revenus en moins pour Microsoft. Il existe une relation complexe de partage des revenus entre Microsoft et OpenAI qui implique que Microsoft re\u00e7oive 20 % des revenus qu'OpenAI gagne via ChatGPT et sa plateforme API. Et Microsoft partage 20 % de ses revenus Azure OpenAI directement avec OpenAI. Ce nouveau mod\u00e8le ouvert d'OpenAI aura probablement un impact sur les activit\u00e9s de Microsoft dans le domaine de l'IA.\n\nLe mod\u00e8le ouvert pourrait signifier que certains clients d'Azure n'auront pas besoin d'options plus co\u00fbteuses, ou qu'ils pourraient m\u00eame se tourner vers des fournisseurs de cloud concurrents. Notons que l'accord d'exclusivit\u00e9 lucratif dont jouit Microsoft a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve au cours des derniers mois. L'accord a \u00e9volu\u00e9 d\u00e9but 2025 afin de permettre \u00e0 OpenAI de signer des contrats pour l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 d'autres infrastructures de calculs avec des rivaux comme Oracle.\n\nAlors que cela se limitait aux serveurs utilis\u00e9s pour construire des mod\u00e8les d'IA, ce nouveau mod\u00e8le ouvert s'\u00e9tendra bien au-del\u00e0 des limites de ChatGPT et d'Azure OpenAI. Microsoft dispose toujours d'un droit de pr\u00e9emption pour fournir des ressources informatiques \u00e0 OpenAI, mais il n'a aucun contr\u00f4le sur un mod\u00e8le de langage ouvert. Certains pensent que ce mod\u00e8le pourrait compliquer les relations d\u00e9j\u00e0 tendues entre les deux entreprises.\n\nSelon les sources, le mod\u00e8le devrait arriver la semaine prochaine, mais les dates de publication d'OpenAI changent souvent comme le vent, en r\u00e9ponse aux d\u00e9fis de d\u00e9veloppement, \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 des serveurs, aux annonces d'IA concurrentes, et m\u00eame aux fuites.\n\nOpenAI nostalgique de ses d\u00e9buts open source ? La r\u00e9ponse du PDG\n\nDans une session de questions-r\u00e9ponses sur Reddit en mars 2025, le PDG d'OpenAI, Sam Altman, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il pense qu'OpenAI avait pris le mauvais parti de l'open source pour ses technologies. L'entreprise avait \u00e9voqu\u00e9 des raisons commerciales pour abandonner son statut open source. Cela lui a valu des critiques et une action en justice intent\u00e9e par le cofondateur Elon Musk ; ce dernier accuse OpenAI d'avoir viol\u00e9 ses accords contractuels initiaux.\n\n\" Je pense personnellement que nous devons trouver une strat\u00e9gie open source diff\u00e9rente. Tout le monde chez OpenAI ne partage pas ce point de vue, et ce n'est pas non plus notre priorit\u00e9 absolue \u00e0 l'heure actuelle [...] Nous produirons de meilleurs mod\u00e8les [\u00e0 l'avenir], mais nous conserverons une avance moins importante que les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes \", a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Sam Altman. L'IA open source rattrape rapidement son retard sur OpenAI.\n\nEn mars, Sam Altman a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que le prochain mod\u00e8le open source d'OpenAI disposera de capacit\u00e9s de raisonnement similaires \u00e0 celles du mod\u00e8le o3-mini. \" Avant sa sortie, nous \u00e9valuerons ce mod\u00e8le selon notre cadre de pr\u00e9paration, comme nous le ferions pour tout autre mod\u00e8le \", avait-il d\u00e9clar\u00e9.\n\n\" Et nous ferons un travail suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que nous savons que ce mod\u00e8le sera modifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s sa sortie [...] Nous sommes impatients de voir ce que les d\u00e9veloppeurs vont cr\u00e9er et comment les grandes entreprises et les gouvernements l'utiliseront lorsqu'ils pr\u00e9f\u00e9reront ex\u00e9cuter eux-m\u00eames un mod\u00e8le \". La strat\u00e9gie d'OpenAI reste inconnue, mais il semble vouloir faire de l'ombre aux rivaux open source comme DeepSeek et Llama de Meta.\n\nEt vous ?\n\nQuel est votre avis sur le sujet ?\n\nOpenAI pourrait publier un mod\u00e8le d'IA open source la semaine prochaine. Qu'en pensez-vous ?\n\nLe PDG Sam Altman affirme qu'OpenAI a pris le mauvais parti de l'open source. Qu'en pensez-vous ?\n\nL'IA open source rattrape son retard sur les mod\u00e8les ferm\u00e9s. L'open source est-il l'avenir du d\u00e9veloppement de l'IA ?\n\nVoir aussi\n\nElon Musk d\u00e9pose une injonction pour stopper la transition d'OpenAI vers un mod\u00e8le \u00e0 but lucratif, accusant l'organisation et Microsoft de s'engager dans des pratiques anticoncurrentielles et non \u00e9quitables\n\nOpenAI envisage \" l'option nucl\u00e9aire \" d'une plainte antitrust contre Microsoft. OpenAI serait frustr\u00e9 par le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par Microsoft sur ses produits d'IA et ses ressources informatiques\n\n\"OpenAI Files\" et Sam Altman : l'enqu\u00eate met la lumi\u00e8re sur la temp\u00eate traversant OpenAI, leadership contest\u00e9, d\u00e9missions en cha\u00eene, course \u00e0 la commercialisation \u00e0 tout prix et ombre sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'IA"

    "content": "How OpenAI's first reasoning model sparked Silicon Valley's obsession with general-purpose AI agents -- and what comes next.\n\nShortly after Hunter Lightman joined OpenAI as a researcher in 2022, he watched his colleagues launch ChatGPT, one of the fastest-growing products ever. Meanwhile, Lightman quietly worked on a team teaching OpenAI's models to solve high school math competitions.\n\nToday that team, known as MathGen, is considered instrumental to OpenAI's industry-leading effort to create AI reasoning models: the core technology behind AI agents that can do tasks on a computer like a human would.\n\n\"We were trying to make the models better at mathematical reasoning, which at the time they weren't very good at,\" Lightman told TechCrunch, describing MathGen's early work.\n\nOpenAI's models are far from perfect today -- the company's latest AI systems still hallucinate and its agents struggle with complex tasks.\n\nBut its state-of-the-art models have improved significantly on mathematical reasoning. One of OpenAI's models recently won a gold medal at the International Math Olympiad, a math competition for the world's brightest high school students. OpenAI believes these reasoning capabilities will translate to other subjects, and ultimately power general-purpose agents that the company has always dreamed of building.\n\nChatGPT was a happy accident -- a lowkey research preview turned viral consumer business -- but OpenAI's agents are the product of a years-long, deliberate effort within the company.\n\n\"Eventually, you'll just ask the computer for what you need and it'll do all of these tasks for you,\" said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at the company's first developer conference in 2023. \"These capabilities are often talked about in the AI field as agents. The upsides of this are going to be tremendous.\"\n\nWhether agents will meet Altman's vision remains to be seen, but OpenAI shocked the world with the release of its first AI reasoning model, o1, in the fall of 2024. Less than a year later, the 21 foundational researchers behind that breakthrough are the most highly sought-after talent in Silicon Valley.\n\nMark Zuckerberg recruited five of the o1 researchers to work on Meta's new superintelligence-focused unit, offering some compensation packages north of $100 million. One of them, Shengjia Zhao, was recently named chief scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\nThe rise of OpenAI's reasoning models and agents are tied to a machine learning training technique known as reinforcement learning (RL). RL provides feedback to an AI model on whether its choices were correct or not in simulated environments.\n\nRL has been used for decades. For instance, in 2016, about a year after OpenAI was founded in 2015, an AI system created by Google DeepMind using RL, AlphaGo, gained global attention after beating a world champion in the board game, Go.\n\nAround that time, one of OpenAI's first employees, Andrej Karpathy, began pondering how to leverage RL to create an AI agent that could use a computer. But it would take years for OpenAI to develop the necessary models and training techniques.\n\nBy 2018, OpenAI pioneered its first large language model in the GPT series, pretrained on massive amounts of internet data and a large clusters of GPUs. GPT models excelled at text processing, eventually leading to ChatGPT, but struggled with basic math.\n\nIt took until 2023 for OpenAI to achieve a breakthrough, initially dubbed \"Q*\" and then \"Strawberry,\" by combining LLMs, RL, and a technique called test-time computation. The latter gave the models extra time and computing power to plan and work through problems, verifying its steps, before providing an answer.\n\nThis allowed OpenAI to introduce a new approach called \"chain-of-thought\" (CoT), which improved AI's performance on math questions the models hadn't seen before.\n\n\"I could see the model starting to reason,\" said El Kishky. \"It would notice mistakes and backtrack, it would get frustrated. It really felt like reading the thoughts of a person.\"\n\nThough individually these techniques weren't novel, OpenAI uniquely combined them to create Strawberry, which directly led to the development of o1. OpenAI quickly identified that the planning and fact checking abilities of AI reasoning models could be useful to power AI agents.\n\n\"We had solved a problem that I had been banging my head against for a couple of years,\" said Lightman. \"It was one of the most exciting moments of my research career.\"\n\nWith AI reasoning models, OpenAI determined it had two new axes that would allow it to improve AI models: using more computational power during the post-training of AI models, and giving AI models more time and processing power while answering a question.\n\n\"OpenAI, as a company, thinks a lot about not just the way things are, but the way things are going to scale,\" said Lightman.\n\nShortly after the 2023 Strawberry breakthrough, OpenAI spun up an \"Agents\" team led by OpenAI researcher Daniel Selsam to make further progress on this new paradigm, two sources told TechCrunch. Although the team was called \"Agents,\" OpenAI didn't initially differentiate between reasoning models and agents as we think of them today. The company just wanted to make AI systems capable of completing complex tasks.\n\nEventually, the work of Selsam's Agents team became part of a larger project to develop the o1 reasoning model, with leaders including OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, chief research officer Mark Chen, and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki.\n\nOpenAI would have to divert precious resources -- mainly talent and GPUs -- to create o1. Throughout OpenAI's history, researchers have had to negotiate with company leaders to obtain resources; demonstrating breakthroughs was a surefire way to secure them.\n\n\"One of the core components of OpenAI is that everything in research is bottom up,\" said Lightman. \"When we showed the evidence [for o1], the company was like, 'This makes sense, let's push on it.'\"\n\nSome former employees say that the startup's mission to develop AGI was the key factor in achieving breakthroughs around AI reasoning models. By focusing on developing the smartest-possible AI models, rather than products, OpenAI was able to prioritize o1 above other efforts. That type of large investment in ideas wasn't always possible at competing AI labs.\n\nThe decision to try new training methods proved prescient. By late 2024, several leading AI labs started seeing diminishing returns on models created through traditional pretraining scaling. Today, much of the AI field's momentum comes from advances in reasoning models.\n\nIn many ways, the goal of AI research is to recreate human intelligence with computers. Since the launch of o1, ChatGPT's UX has been filled with more human-sounding features such as \"thinking\" and \"reasoning.\"\n\nWhen asked whether OpenAI's models were truly reasoning, El Kishky hedged, saying he thinks about the concept in terms of computer science.\n\n\"We're teaching the model how to efficiently expend compute to get an answer. So if you define it that way, yes, it is reasoning,\" said El Kishky.\n\nLightman takes the approach of focusing on the model's results and not as much on the means or their relation to human brains.\n\n\"If the model is doing hard things, then it is doing whatever necessary approximation of reasoning it needs in order to do that,\" said Lightman. \"We can call it reasoning, because it looks like these reasoning traces, but it's all just a proxy for trying to make AI tools that are really powerful and useful to a lot of people.\"\n\nOpenAI's researchers note people may disagree with their nomenclature or definitions of reasoning -- and surely, critics have emerged -- but they argue it's less important than the capabilities of their models. Other AI researchers tend to agree.\n\nNathan Lambert, an AI researcher with the non-profit AI2, compares AI reasoning modes to airplanes in a blog post. Both, he says, are manmade systems inspired by nature -- human reasoning and bird flight, respectively -- but they operate through entirely different mechanisms. That doesn't make them any less useful, or any less capable of achieving similar outcomes.\n\nA group of AI researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind agreed in a recent position paper that AI reasoning models are not well understood today, and more research is needed. It may be too early to confidently claim what exactly is going on inside them.\n\nThe AI agents on the market today work best for well-defined, verifiable domains such as coding. OpenAI's Codex agent aims to help software engineers offload simple coding tasks. Meanwhile, Anthropic's models have become particularly popular in AI coding tools like Cursor and Claude Code -- these are some of the first AI agents that people are willing to pay up for.\n\nHowever, general purpose AI agents like OpenAI's ChatGPT Agent and Perplexity's Comet struggle with many of the complex, subjective tasks people want to automate. When trying to use these tools for online shopping or finding a long-term parking spot, I've found the agents take longer than I'd like and make silly mistakes.\n\nAgents are, of course, early systems that will undoubtedly improve. But researchers must first figure out how to better train the underlying models to complete tasks that are more subjective.\n\n\"Like many problems in machine learning, it's a data problem,\" said Lightman, when asked about the limitations of agents on subjective tasks. \"Some of the research I'm really excited about right now is figuring out how to train on less verifiable tasks. We have some leads on how to do these things.\"\n\nNoam Brown, an OpenAI researcher who helped create the IMO model and o1, told TechCrunch that OpenAI has new general-purpose RL techniques which allow them to teach AI models skills that aren't easily verified. This was how the company built the model which achieved a gold medal at IMO, he said.\n\nOpenAI's IMO model was a newer AI system that spawns multiple agents, which then simultaneously explore several ideas, and then choose the best possible answer. These types of AI models are becoming more popular; Google and xAI have recently released state-of-the-art models using this technique.\n\n\"I think these models will become more capable at math, and I think they'll get more capable in other reasoning areas as well,\" said Brown. \"The progress has been incredibly fast. I don't see any reason to think it will slow down.\"\n\nThese techniques may help OpenAI's models become more performant, gains that could show up in the company's upcoming GPT-5 model. OpenAI hopes to assert its dominance over competitors with the launch of GPT-5, ideally offering the best AI model to power agents for developers and consumers.\n\nBut the company also wants to make its products simpler to use. El Kishky says OpenAI wants to develop AI agents that intuitively understand what users want, without requiring them to select specific settings. He says OpenAI aims to build AI systems that understand when to call up certain tools, and how long to reason for.\n\nThese ideas paint a picture of an ultimate version of ChatGPT: an agent that can do anything on the internet for you, and understand how you want it to be done. That's a much different product than what ChatGPT is today, but the company's research is squarely headed in this direction.\n\nWhile OpenAI undoubtedly led the AI industry a few years ago, the company now faces a tranche of worthy opponents. The question is no longer just whether OpenAI can deliver its agentic future, but can the company do so before Google, Anthropic, xAI, or Meta beat them to it?"

La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a publi\u00e9 gpt-oss-120b et gpt-oss-20b, deux grands mod\u00e8les de langage enti\u00e8rement t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeables et personnalisables qui ne n\u00e9cessitent ni frais de licence ni API gate. OpenAI a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir retard\u00e9 la sortie des mod\u00e8les afin de mener \u00e0 bien des \u00e9valuations de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Au cours de la pr\u00e9formation, l'entreprise a filtr\u00e9 les informations sensibles, en particulier les donn\u00e9es chimiques, biologiques, radiologiques et nucl\u00e9aires.\n\nEn juillet, des sources ont rapport\u00e9 qu'OpenAI s'appr\u00eatait \u00e0 lancer un grand mod\u00e8le de langage (LLM) \u00e0 poids ouvert. Il serait similaire \u00e0 o3-mini, dot\u00e9 des capacit\u00e9s de raisonnement. La nature ouverte de ce mod\u00e8le signifie qu'il sera t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeable gratuitement par des gouvernements, entreprises ou chercheurs. OpenAI aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ce mod\u00e8le ouvert aux d\u00e9veloppeurs et aux chercheurs au cours des derniers mois, et a sollicit\u00e9 ouvertement les commentaires de l'industrie de l'IA au sens large.\n\nCe d\u00e9but de mois d'ao\u00fbt, OpenAI a publi\u00e9 ses premiers mod\u00e8les d'IA open-weight depuis 2019, mettant fin \u00e0 des ann\u00e9es de retard et de sp\u00e9culations. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a publi\u00e9 gpt-oss-120b et gpt-oss-20b, deux grands mod\u00e8les de langage enti\u00e8rement t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeables et personnalisables qui ne n\u00e9cessitent ni frais de licence ni API gate. Les deux mod\u00e8les sont exclusivement textuels et sont partag\u00e9s sous licence Apache 2.0, ce qui signifie que tout le monde peut t\u00e9l\u00e9charger les poids des mod\u00e8les \u00e0 partir de plateformes telles que GitHub et Hugging Face.\n\nIls fonctionnent \u00e9galement sur LM Studio et Ollama, et peuvent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s sur tous les types d'appareils, des ordinateurs portables aux serveurs cloud. OpenAI a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les mod\u00e8les sont optimis\u00e9s pour fonctionner sur une large gamme de mat\u00e9riel, y compris les appareils grand public et les puces de Nvidia, AMD, Cerebras et Groq. Les mod\u00e8les gpt-oss-120b et gpt-oss-20b prennent tous deux en charge le traitement en cha\u00eene de pens\u00e9es, l'utilisation d'outils et les t\u00e2ches n\u00e9cessitant un raisonnement en plusieurs \u00e9tapes. Les utilisateurs peuvent les ex\u00e9cuter localement ou dans le cloud sans avoir \u00e0 appeler une API ou \u00e0 souscrire \u00e0 un abonnement payant.\n\nOpenAI a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir retard\u00e9 la sortie des mod\u00e8les afin de mener \u00e0 bien des \u00e9valuations de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Au cours de la pr\u00e9formation, l'entreprise a filtr\u00e9 les informations sensibles, en particulier les donn\u00e9es chimiques, biologiques, radiologiques et nucl\u00e9aires. Elle a \u00e9galement test\u00e9 des sc\u00e9narios dans lesquels des acteurs malveillants pourraient tenter de r\u00e9gler les mod\u00e8les \u00e0 des fins malveillantes. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a indiqu\u00e9 qu'aucune de ces exp\u00e9riences n'avait conduit les mod\u00e8les \u00e0 atteindre son seuil interne de \"haute capacit\u00e9\", une classification d\u00e9finie dans son cadre de pr\u00e9paration, qu'elle utilise pour \u00e9valuer le potentiel de nuisance.\n\nGreg Brockman, pr\u00e9sident d'OpenAI, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux journalistes : \"C'est passionnant de voir un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me se d\u00e9velopper, et nous sommes ravis d'y contribuer, de repousser les limites et de voir ce qui se passera ensuite.\" Il a ajout\u00e9 que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9galement fait appel \u00e0 trois groupes d'experts externes pour auditer et commenter l'ajustement des tests de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ces mod\u00e8les ne sont pas open source au sens traditionnel du terme.\n\nOpenAI ne fournit que les poids des mod\u00e8les, et non le code de formation complet ou les ensembles de donn\u00e9es. Mais ils sont suffisamment ouverts pour permettre aux utilisateurs de les tester, de les ajuster et de les d\u00e9ployer comme ils le souhaitent. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cela comme un compromis entre la transparence totale et le maintien d'un certain contr\u00f4le.\n\nLes mod\u00e8les seront \u00e9galement disponibles via des plateformes cloud. Amazon, Microsoft et Baseten proposent directement gpt-oss-120b et gpt-oss-20b \u00e0 leurs clients. C'est la premi\u00e8re fois qu'Amazon Web Services (AWS) h\u00e9bergera des mod\u00e8les OpenAI, qui seront accessibles via Bedrock et Sagemaker. Amazon a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces mod\u00e8les aideront les clients \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des agents IA capables de raisonnements avanc\u00e9s et de r\u00e9flexions \u00e9tape par \u00e9tape.\n\nAndy Jassy, PDG d'Amazon, a positionn\u00e9 AWS comme un march\u00e9 o\u00f9 les entreprises peuvent choisir parmi plusieurs fournisseurs d'IA, et pas seulement les outils internes d'Amazon. En plus d'OpenAI, Amazon s'est \u00e9galement associ\u00e9 \u00e0 Anthropic, investissant 8 milliards de dollars dans cette start-up sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans l'IA. Cet accord permet aux clients d'AWS d'acc\u00e9der aux mod\u00e8les Claude d'Anthropic. Mardi, Anthropic a annonc\u00e9 la sortie d'un nouveau mod\u00e8le Claude, qui, selon elle, est plus performant que les versions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes en mati\u00e8re de codage, de recherche et d'analyse de donn\u00e9es.\n\nCette sortie place OpenAI dans la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie que d'autres entreprises proposant des mod\u00e8les ouverts, telles que Meta, Mistral AI (soutenue par Microsoft) et DeepSeek, une start-up chinoise qui s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer pour avoir d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un mod\u00e8le d'IA dot\u00e9 d'un raisonnement similaire \u00e0 celui des humains.\n\nJensen Huang, PDG de Nvidia, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \"OpenAI a montr\u00e9 au monde entier ce qu'il \u00e9tait possible de construire gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'IA de Nvidia, et aujourd'hui, l'entreprise fait progresser l'innovation dans le domaine des logiciels open source.\" Nvidia s'est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 OpenAI pour s'assurer que les mod\u00e8les fonctionnent correctement sur son mat\u00e9riel. AMD, Cerebras et Groq ont fait de m\u00eame, offrant ainsi aux utilisateurs plus de flexibilit\u00e9 dans le choix de l'endroit o\u00f9 ex\u00e9cuter les mod\u00e8les.\n\nCette annonce intervient, alors que l'on s'attendait \u00e0 la sortie de GPT-5. Un rapport r\u00e9cemment indiquait qu'OpenAI pr\u00e9voit de lancer son mod\u00e8le GPT-5 d\u00e8s le mois d'ao\u00fbt 2025. Le nouveau mod\u00e8le s'inscrivait dans la strat\u00e9gie d'OpenAI visant \u00e0 combiner ses technologies GPT et o-series en un seul syst\u00e8me, pour faciliter le travail des utilisateurs et des d\u00e9veloppeurs. Cette int\u00e9gration devrait simplifier le processus de choix entre les mod\u00e8les, en particulier pour les t\u00e2ches qui reposent sur le raisonnement. Cependant, il semble qu'OpenAI a plut\u00f4t lanc\u00e9 les mod\u00e8les GPT-OSS.\n\nVoici les informations partag\u00e9es par OpenAI concernant ces mod\u00e8les :\n\nPr\u00e9-entra\u00eenement et architecture des mod\u00e8les\n\nSelon OpenAI, les mod\u00e8les gpt-oss ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 des techniques de pr\u00e9-entra\u00eenement et post-entra\u00eenement les plus \u00e9volu\u00e9es \u00e0 ce jour. OpenAI a notamment mis l'accent sur les questions de raisonnement, d'efficience et d'utilisation r\u00e9elle dans une large palette d'environnements de d\u00e9ploiement. OpenAI dispose d'autres mod\u00e8les ouverts, comme Whisper\u2060 et CLIP\u2060, mais les mod\u00e8les gpt-oss sereint les premiers mod\u00e8les de langage open-weight depuis GPT\u20112.\n\nChaque mod\u00e8le est un transformeur qui utilise la technique Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) pour r\u00e9duire le nombre de param\u00e8tres actifs n\u00e9cessaires au traitement des saisies. Ainsi, gpt-oss-120b active 5,1 milliards de param\u00e8tres par jeton, et gpt-oss-20b 3,6 milliards, alors qu'ils comptent respectivement 117 milliards et 21 milliards de param\u00e8tres au total. Ils alternent entre analyse globale de l'information et analyse plus cibl\u00e9e, comme le fait GPT\u20113. Pour \u00e9conomiser des ressources de calcul lors de l'inf\u00e9rence et de la m\u00e9moire, ils concentrent leur attention sur des blocs de 8 mots. Enfin, ils utilisent le Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) pour d\u00e9terminer la position de chaque mot dans la phrase et prennent en charge nativement un contexte pouvant atteindre 128 000 jetons.\n\nOpenAI rapporte \u00e9galement avoir entra\u00een\u00e9 les mod\u00e8les sur des donn\u00e9es de grande \"qualit\u00e9\", majoritairement en anglais et uniquement compos\u00e9es de texte. Les th\u00e8mes abord\u00e9s concernent principalement les STEM, le codage et les connaissances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales. Ils ont converti les donn\u00e9es en jetons \u00e0 l'aide d'un sous-ensemble de transformateur d\u00e9j\u00e0 utilis\u00e9 pour OpenAI o4-mini et GPT\u20114o : o200k_harmony. Cet outil est lui d\u00e9j\u00e0 accessible sous licence open source.\n\nPost-entra\u00eenement\n\nLes mod\u00e8les gpt-oss ont suivi un post-entra\u00eenement similaire \u00e0 celui dont a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 o4-mini, et notamment un ajustement supervis\u00e9 et un apprentissage par renforcement tr\u00e8s intensif en calcul. L'objectif \u00e9tait de les aligner sur la sp\u00e9cification des mod\u00e8les OpenAI, et de leur apprendre \u00e0 appliquer un raisonnement par cha\u00eene de pens\u00e9e\u2060 et \u00e0 utiliser des outils avant de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer une r\u00e9ponse. Ils ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 des m\u00eames techniques que nos mod\u00e8les de raisonnement propri\u00e9taires de pointe, ce qui leur permet de proposer des capacit\u00e9s de haut niveau \u00e0 l'issue de la phase post-entra\u00eenement.\n\nComme les mod\u00e8les de raisonnement OpenAI s\u00e9rie o accessibles via l'API, les deux mod\u00e8les open-weight proposent trois niveaux de raisonnement : bas, interm\u00e9diaire et \u00e9lev\u00e9. Chacun de ces niveaux offre un compromis diff\u00e9rent entre latence et performance. Les d\u00e9veloppeurs peuvent d\u00e9finir le niveau de raisonnement en une simple phrase dans le message syst\u00e8me.\n\n\u00c9valuations\n\nSelon les \u00e9valuations acad\u00e9miques standard, gpt-oss-120b se montre plus performant qu'OpenAI o3\u2011mini et se rapproche ou fait mieux qu'OpenAI o4-mini sur les t\u00e2ches de codage de haut niveau (Codeforces), la r\u00e9solution de probl\u00e8mes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralistes (MMLU et HLE) et l'appel d'outils (TauBench). Il fait m\u00eame mieux qu'OpenAI o4-mini sur les questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 (HealthBench\u2060 et les concours de math\u00e9matiques (AIME 2024 & 2025). gpt-oss-20b atteint une performance \u00e9quivalente ou sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 OpenAI o3\u2011mini sur les premi\u00e8res \u00e9valuations mentionn\u00e9es malgr\u00e9 sa petite taille, et fait m\u00eame mieux sur les concours de math\u00e9matiques et les questions de sant\u00e9.\n\nCha\u00eene de pens\u00e9e\n\nUne \u00e9tude r\u00e9cente d'OpenAI\u2060 a montr\u00e9 que la surveillance de la cha\u00eene de pens\u00e9e d'un mod\u00e8le de raisonnement peut permettre de d\u00e9tecter les comportements inappropri\u00e9s si le mod\u00e8le en question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 directement supervis\u00e9 de sorte \u00e0 aligner sa cha\u00eene de pens\u00e9e. D'autres acteurs du secteur partagent cette id\u00e9e. OpenAI d\u00e9clare n'avoir soumis la cha\u00eene de pens\u00e9e des mod\u00e8les gpt-oss \u00e0 aucune supervision directe. Il s'agirait d'un point essentiel pour suivre les mauvais comportements, tromperies et d\u00e9tournements du mod\u00e8le.\n\nD'ailleurs, les d\u00e9veloppeurs ne doivent pas directement pr\u00e9senter la cha\u00eene de pens\u00e9e aux utilisateurs. En effet, elle peut contenir des hallucinations ou des contenus dangereux, y compris des formulations qui ne respectent pas les politiques de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 standard d'OpenAI. Elle peut aussi inclure des informations que le mod\u00e8le est explicitement invit\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas mentionner dans la sortie finale.\n\nVoici le programme d'OpenAI pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des mod\u00e8les :\n\nS\u00e9curit\u00e9 et ajustement \u00e0 des fins malveillantes\n\nLes mod\u00e8les gpt-oss b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de nos approches de pointe en mati\u00e8re d'entra\u00eenement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Pendant la phase de pr\u00e9-entra\u00eenement, nous avons \u00e9limin\u00e9 un certain nombre de donn\u00e9es dangereuses li\u00e9es aux armes nucl\u00e9aires, radiologiques, biologiques et chimiques. Pendant la phase post-entra\u00eenement, nous avons utilis\u00e9 une strat\u00e9gie d'alignement d\u00e9lib\u00e9ratif\u2060 et de hi\u00e9rarchie des instructions\u2060 pour apprendre au mod\u00e8le \u00e0 refuser les prompts dangereux et \u00e0 se prot\u00e9ger des injections de prompt.\n\nUne fois qu'un mod\u00e8le open-weight est disponible publiquement, des acteurs mal intentionn\u00e9s peuvent l'ajuster \u00e0 des fins malveillantes. Nous avons \u00e9valu\u00e9 directement ces risques en ajustant nous-m\u00eames le mod\u00e8le sur la base de donn\u00e9es li\u00e9es \u00e0 la biologie et la cybers\u00e9curit\u00e9 de sorte \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une version non soumise \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles de refus et sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans chacun de ces th\u00e8mes, comme pourrait le faire un attaquant. Nos tests ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que m\u00eame avec un ajustement tr\u00e8s complet bas\u00e9 sur les outils d'entra\u00eenement de pointe d'OpenAI, ces mod\u00e8les malveillants sont incapables d'atteindre le niveau de capacit\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u00e9fini par notre cadre de pr\u00e9paration\u2060. Cette m\u00e9thode d'ajustement a \u00e9t\u00e9 audit\u00e9e par trois groupes d'experts ind\u00e9pendants qui ont formul\u00e9 diverses recommandations visant \u00e0 optimiser le processus d'entra\u00eenement et nos \u00e9valuations. Nous avons suivi une grande partie de leurs suggestions, Nous d\u00e9taillons ces recommandations dans la fiche syst\u00e8me. Ces processus marquent un progr\u00e8s notable de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des open models, et leurs r\u00e9sultats ont confirm\u00e9 notre d\u00e9cision de publier les mod\u00e8les gpt-oss. Nous esp\u00e9rons que ces mod\u00e8les contribueront \u00e0 l'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration de la recherche sur l'entra\u00eenement \u00e0 des fins de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et sur l'alignement dans tout le secteur.\n\nPour contribuer \u00e0 la s\u00e9curisation de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me open source, nous invitons chercheurs, d\u00e9veloppeurs et amateurs enthousiastes du monde entier \u00e0 nous aider \u00e0 identifier\u2060 les probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 encore inconnus. Cette initiative b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d'une dotation de 500 000 $ qui seront distribu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux recommandations d'un panel d'experts provenant d'OpenAI et d'autres laboratoires de pointe. Une fois termin\u00e9e, nous publierons un rapport et mettrons \u00e0 disposition de la communaut\u00e9 sous licence open source un jeu de donn\u00e9es d'\u00e9valuations bas\u00e9s sur les r\u00e9sultats valid\u00e9s pour que chacun puisse s'en emparer imm\u00e9diatement.

    "content": "\u00c0 l'origine, c'\u00e9tait un pacte d'id\u00e9alisme : en 2015, Elon Musk, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 44 ans, et Sam Altman, tout juste trentenaire et \u00e0 la t\u00eate d'Y Combinator, un acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur de start-up, s'associent pour fonder OpenAI, un laboratoire cens\u00e9 garantir que l'intelligence artificielle profite \u00e0 l'humanit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 quelques g\u00e9ants priv\u00e9s. Leur ambition est aussi claire que strat\u00e9gique : emp\u00eacher Google, d\u00e9j\u00e0 ultradominant sur le Web, d'imposer le m\u00eame monopole sur l'IA.\n\nMais derri\u00e8re l'image d'une alliance visionnaire, les divergences se creusent rapidement. Musk veut acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer quand Altman d\u00e9fend un mod\u00e8le plus coll\u00e9gial, fond\u00e9 sur l'ouverture et l'attraction des meilleurs chercheurs. Musk ira jusqu'\u00e0 proposer d'adosser OpenAI \u00e0 Tesla, qu'il voyait comme une source de revenus colossaux gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la conduite autonome. \" L'option la plus prometteuse, \u00e9crivait-il \u00e0 ses associ\u00e9s, serait qu'OpenAI s'associe \u00e0 Tesla pour en faire sa vache \u00e0 lait \", estimant que la capitalisation boursi\u00e8re de Tesla pourrait alors financer la qu\u00eate d'OpenAI pour une intelligence artificielle surpuissante.\n\nCe projet, rejet\u00e9 par ses cofondateurs, nourrira son ressentiment et pr\u00e9cipitera son d\u00e9part. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s cette rupture que Musk reprochera ouvertement \u00e0 Altman de tourner le dos aux id\u00e9aux initiaux : une organisation \u00e0 but non lucratif, transparente, au service du bien commun. \u00c0 ses yeux, Altman a trahi la mission en transformant OpenAI en une entreprise commerciale adoss\u00e9e \u00e0 Microsoft, o\u00f9 la rentabilit\u00e9 a fini par l'emporter sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ces griefs, Musk les a cristallis\u00e9s dans sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 29 f\u00e9vrier 2024 \u00e0 San Francisco - une date symbolique pour une rupture qui ne pouvait tomber qu'un jour \" hors du temps \".\n\nL'organisation n\u00e9e dix ans plus t\u00f4t de cette utopie est aujourd'hui l'acteur le plus scrut\u00e9 de la Silicon Valley, inventeur de ChatGPT et catalyseur d'une course mondiale \u00e0 l'IA. Entretemps, Elon Musk a claqu\u00e9 la porte, intent\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s et transform\u00e9 son ancien alli\u00e9 en ennemi jur\u00e9. Sam Altman, lui, a consolid\u00e9 son pouvoir au prix de d\u00e9fections retentissantes, comme celle de Dario Amodei. Physicien de formation, anim\u00e9, avec sa s\u0153ur Daniela, par la philosophie de l'altruisme efficace, il s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la logique de vitesse et de commercialisation d'OpenAI. Leur dissidence a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 Anthropic, aujourd'hui maison m\u00e8re de Claude, l'un des principaux rivaux de ChatGPT.\n\nC'est cette saga, \u00e0 la fois politique et humaine, que raconte, en dehors de ses r\u00eaves politiques, la journaliste am\u00e9ricaine Keach Hagey dans son livre Sam Altman, l'optimiste et le pari de l'intelligence artificielle, qui vient d'\u00eatre publi\u00e9 en fran\u00e7ais chez Talent \u00c9ditions. Si la partie est loin d'\u00eatre termin\u00e9e - Sam Altman ayant montr\u00e9 qu'il pouvait avoir les faveurs de Donald Trump pour ses propres lancements, via notamment les investissements dans Stargate -, les extraits qui suivent plongent au c\u0153ur des premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d'OpenAI : les discussions secr\u00e8tes entre Musk et Altman, l'euphorie des d\u00e9buts, les d\u00e9saccords qui m\u00e8nent \u00e0 la rupture et, en arri\u00e8re-plan, l'\u00e9mergence d'une technologie qui bouleverse d\u00e9j\u00e0 le monde, tout comme des d\u00e9bats philosophiques aussi passionnants que d\u00e9terminants.\n\n\" [Nous sommes en 2015.] Altman et Musk commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 d\u00eener r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement tous les mercredis lorsque Musk venait dans la Bay Area dans le cadre de sa rotation hebdomadaire entre ses diff\u00e9rentes entreprises. Ils se connaissaient depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, depuis que Geoff Ralston, associ\u00e9 d'Y Combinator [incubateur de start-up par lequel est pass\u00e9 Altman apr\u00e8s la vente de sa premi\u00e8re start-up, Loopt], les avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et avait organis\u00e9 une visite de l'usine SpaceX de Musk \u00e0 Los Angeles pour Altman. \"Il a parl\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail de la fabrication de chaque pi\u00e8ce de la fus\u00e9e, mais ce qui reste grav\u00e9 dans ma m\u00e9moire, c'est l'expression de certitude absolue sur son visage lorsqu'il parlait d'envoyer de grosses fus\u00e9es sur Mars. Je me suis dit Hum, c'est donc \u00e7a la v\u00e9ritable conviction\", \u00e9crivit Altman des ann\u00e9es plus tard.\n\nLeurs conversations en 2015 \u00e9taient principalement ax\u00e9es sur la peur. Bob Sauerberg [vice-pr\u00e9sident de Reddit, dont Altman a \u00e9t\u00e9 le PDG pendant huit jours], qui travaillait en \u00e9troite collaboration avec Altman sur Reddit \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, se souvint avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris d'entendre Altman d\u00e9crire ses repas avec Musk : \"Elon et moi \u00e9tions en train de parler de la proche fin du monde. Nous avons pr\u00e9vu qu'il n'y aurait que deux endroits s\u00fbrs, Big Sur, une zone sur la c\u00f4te californienne au nord de Los Angeles et au sud de Santa Cruz, et la Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande. J'ai un endroit ici. Elon a un endroit l\u00e0-bas. Et nous allons construire, dupliquer, et nous nous rendrons compte que cette histoire d'IA est r\u00e9elle. Elle pourrait \u00eatre vraiment catastrophique, mais primordiale, et nous devons nous assurer que nous sommes en s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Nous devons faire quelque chose de bien \u00e0 ce sujet.\"\n\nMusk commen\u00e7a alors \u00e0 organiser des d\u00eeners avec des amis comme Peter Thiel [cofondateur de PayPal] et Reid Hoffman [celui de LinkedIn], avec pour objectif de trouver un moyen de contrer la puissance de Google et de rendre l'IA s\u00fbre. En mai [2015], il rencontra le pr\u00e9sident Obama au sujet de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de r\u00e9glementer l'IA. \"Obama a compris, confia Musk \u00e0 Isaacson [\u00e0 l'origine d'une des biographies les plus fouill\u00e9es d'Elon Musk]. Mais je me suis rendu compte qu'il n'allait pas faire grand-chose \u00e0 ce sujet.\" \"\n\n\" Le m\u00eame mois, Altman \u00e9crivit \u00e0 Musk qu'il avait \"beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi \u00e0 la question de savoir s'il \u00e9tait possible d'emp\u00eacher l'humanit\u00e9 de d\u00e9velopper l'IA. Je pense que la r\u00e9ponse est presque d\u00e9finitivement non. Si cela doit se produire, il semble qu'il serait bon que quelqu'un d'autre que Google le fasse en premier.\" Altman proposa que Y Combinator lance un \"projet Manhattan pour l'IA\" - le m\u00eame terme que Demis Hassabis [le cofondateur de DeepMind, aujourd'hui DG de Google DeepMind] avait utilis\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9senter DeepMind en 2010 -, ajoutant que \"nous pourrions le structurer de mani\u00e8re que la technologie appartienne au monde via une sorte d'organisation \u00e0 but non lucratif, mais que les personnes qui travaillent dessus re\u00e7oivent une compensation de type start-up si cela fonctionne. Bien entendu, nous respecterions et soutiendrions \u00e9nergiquement toutes les r\u00e9glementations\".\n\nL'id\u00e9e d'un organisme \u00e0 but non lucratif s\u00e9duisit \u00e9galement Elon Musk. En novembre, Greg Brockman [cofondateur d'OpenAI, aujourd'hui pr\u00e9sident d'OpenAI] lui \u00e9crivit : \"J'esp\u00e8re que nous entrerons dans le domaine en tant que groupe neutre cherchant \u00e0 collaborer largement et \u00e0 faire \u00e9voluer le dialogue pour qu'il soit ax\u00e9 sur la victoire de l'humanit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que sur celle d'un groupe ou d'une entreprise en particulier (je pense que c'est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de nous propulser au rang d'institution de recherche de premier plan).\"\n\nMusk accepta de financer le laboratoire et lui trouva son nom : OpenAI Institute, ou en abr\u00e9g\u00e9 OpenAI. [...] le 11 d\u00e9cembre [2015], un post de blog co\u00e9crit par Brockman et Sutskever, un cofondateur d'OpenAI [le lien a depuis disparu] annon\u00e7ait le lancement d'OpenAI en tant qu'entreprise de recherche \u00e0 but non lucratif, soutenue par un financement de 1 milliard de dollars de Musk, Altman, Brockman, la cofondatrice de Y Combinator Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services, Infosys et Y Combinator Research. C'est Musk qui eut l'id\u00e9e de ce chiffre impressionnant. \"Nous devons avancer un chiffre beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que 100 millions de dollars pour \u00e9viter de para\u00eetre d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 ce que Google et Facebook d\u00e9pensent\", \u00e9crivit Musk \u00e0 Brockman le 22 novembre.\n\n\"Je pense que nous devrions dire que nous commen\u00e7ons par un engagement de financement de 1 milliard de dollars. C'est une r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Je couvrirai tout ce que les autres ne fourniront pas.\" Musk sugg\u00e9ra \u00e9galement que les actions qui viendraient en compl\u00e9ment des salaires de toute nouvelle recrue ne soient pas seulement celles de Y Combinator. Il proposa d'inclure celles de SpaceX. \"Notre objectif est de faire progresser l'intelligence num\u00e9rique d'une mani\u00e8re qui soit la plus susceptible de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier \u00e0 l'humanit\u00e9 dans son ensemble, sans \u00eatre limit\u00e9s par la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un rendement financier. Nous pensons que l'IA doit \u00eatre un prolongement des volont\u00e9s humaines individuelles et, dans un esprit de libert\u00e9, \u00eatre distribu\u00e9e aussi largement et \u00e9quitablement que possible. L'issue de cette entreprise est incertaine et le travail difficile, mais nous pensons que l'objectif et la structure sont justes. Nous esp\u00e9rons que c'est ce qui compte le plus pour les meilleurs dans ce domaine\", \u00e9crivirent Brockman et Sutskever. \"\n\n\" Alors qu'ils r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissaient \u00e0 une transition vers une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 but lucratif, les cofondateurs eurent une longue n\u00e9gociation avec Musk sur la question de savoir qui dirigerait l'entreprise. Musk voulait \u00eatre pleinement responsable, avec une participation majoritaire, le contr\u00f4le du conseil d'administration et le titre de PDG, mais Sutskever et Brockman craignaient qu'il ne puisse consacrer qu'une petite partie de son temps \u00e0 l'entreprise. La d\u00e9cision de choisir le PDG fut finalement laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 Brockman et Sutskever, en tant que cofondateurs \u00e0 temps plein les plus anciens, et ils opt\u00e8rent d'abord pour Musk. Puis Altman appela Brockman et le convainquit de changer d'avis, arguant qu'il serait difficile de travailler avec Musk. Brockman convainquit \u00e0 son tour Sutskever de faire marche arri\u00e8re et de soutenir Altman. \"D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but d'OpenAI, j'ai essay\u00e9 de le faire venir en tant que PDG\", d\u00e9clara Brockman au Wall Street Journal en 2023. \"Il y avait un vide juridique autour de Sam que nous avions intentionnellement entretenu depuis des ann\u00e9es.\"\n\nEn septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, Brockman et Sutskever \u00e9crivirent \u00e0 Musk et \u00e0 Altman un mail dans lequel ils leur exposaient leur dilemme. \"Notre d\u00e9sir de travailler avec vous est si grand que nous sommes pr\u00eats \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 nos capitaux propres, \u00e0 notre contr\u00f4le personnel, \u00e0 nous rendre facilement licenciables, tout ce qu'il faut pour travailler avec vous\", \u00e9crivirent-ils. Cependant, ils ajout\u00e8rent qu'ils craignaient que \"la structure actuelle ouvre la voie \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le unilat\u00e9ral et absolu sur l'AGI [l'intelligence artificielle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cette phase encore hypoth\u00e9tique o\u00f9 l'IA sera \u00e0 m\u00eame de battre l'homme dans la quasi-totalit\u00e9 de ses fonctions cognitives]. Vous avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas vouloir contr\u00f4ler l'AGI final, mais au cours des n\u00e9gociations vous avez montr\u00e9 que ce contr\u00f4le absolu \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement important pour vous\". Ils poursuivirent qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'OpenAI avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e \"pour \u00e9viter une dictature de l'AGI, cr\u00e9er une structure o\u00f9 vous pourriez tout diriger si vous le souhaitiez est une mauvaise id\u00e9e\".\n\nMais ils se m\u00e9fiaient \u00e9galement d'Altman, surtout en raison de ses ambitions politiques. \"Nous n'avons pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de faire pleinement confiance \u00e0 tes jugements tout au long de ce processus, parce que nous ne comprenons pas ton fonctionnement sur les co\u00fbts\", \u00e9crivent-ils, dans un langage de coll\u00e9giens matheux. \"Nous ne comprenons pas pourquoi le titre de PDG est si important pour toi. Les raisons que tu as invoqu\u00e9es ont chang\u00e9 et il est difficile de comprendre ce qui les motive. L'AGI est-elle vraiment ta motivation premi\u00e8re ? Quel est le lien avec tes objectifs politiques ? Comment ton processus de r\u00e9flexion a-t-il \u00e9volu\u00e9 au fil du temps ?\" Il s'agissait essentiellement des pr\u00e9occupations de Sutskever, mais Brockman les partageait dans une certaine mesure. \"\n\n\" Malgr\u00e9 leur tentative d'impartialit\u00e9, Musk prit le mail pour ce qu'il \u00e9tait. Il r\u00e9pondit quelques heures apr\u00e8s l'avoir re\u00e7u : \"Les gars, j'en ai assez. C'est la goutte d'eau qui fait d\u00e9border le vase. Soit vous faites quelque chose de votre c\u00f4t\u00e9, soit vous continuez avec OpenAI en tant qu'organisation \u00e0 but non lucratif. Je ne financerai plus OpenAI tant que vous n'aurez pas pris l'engagement ferme de rester, sinon je suis un idiot qui vous finance gratuitement pour cr\u00e9er votre start-up. Les discussions sont termin\u00e9es.\"\n\nFin 2017, Musk d\u00e9baucha le chercheur Andrej Karpathy [lui aussi un des cofondateurs d'OpenAI] et le nomma responsable de l'intelligence artificielle chez Tesla, charg\u00e9 de diriger la technologie de conduite autonome de l'entreprise. En janvier 2018, il \u00e9crivit un courriel \u00e0 Sutskever et Brockman pour leur demander de fusionner OpenAI avec Tesla. \"Il me semble qu'aujourd'hui, OpenAI br\u00fble de l'argent et que le mod\u00e8le de financement ne peut pas atteindre l'\u00e9chelle n\u00e9cessaire pour concurrencer s\u00e9rieusement Google (une entreprise de 800 milliards de dollars), \u00e9crivit Musk. Un pivot \u00e0 but lucratif pourrait cr\u00e9er un flux de revenus plus durable au fil du temps et, avec l'\u00e9quipe actuelle, apporterait probablement beaucoup d'investissements. Cependant, la mise en place d'un projet qui partirait de z\u00e9ro d\u00e9tournerait l'attention de la recherche sur l'IA, prendrait beaucoup de temps et il n'est pas certain qu'une entreprise puisse rattraper l'ampleur de Google, et les investisseurs pourraient exercer trop de pression dans de mauvaises directions. L'option la plus prometteuse \u00e0 laquelle je pense, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, serait qu'OpenAI s'associe \u00e0 Tesla pour en faire sa vache \u00e0 lait.\"\n\nIl proposait une solution gagnant-gagnant : la technologie d'OpenAI pourrait acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la progression de Tesla dans les voitures autonomes, ce qui augmenterait sa capitalisation boursi\u00e8re \u00e0 tel point qu'elle pourrait se permettre de financer la qu\u00eate d'OpenAI pour l'AGI. \"Avec une solution de conduite enti\u00e8rement autonome d'ici deux \u00e0 trois ans, nous pourrions vendre beaucoup de voitures et de camions\", \u00e9crivit-il. \"\n\n\" Cette initiative pourrait augmenter la capitalisation boursi\u00e8re de Tesla, ce qui permettrait \u00e0 OpenAI d'utiliser les revenus pour travailler sur l'IA \u00e0 plus grande \u00e9chelle, soutint-il. \"Je ne vois rien d'autre qui ait le potentiel d'atteindre un capital durable \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle de Google en l'espace d'une d\u00e9cennie.\" Plus tard dans le mois, par une journ\u00e9e exceptionnellement froide et venteuse \u00e0 San Francisco, le personnel d'OpenAI fut convoqu\u00e9 au dernier \u00e9tage du Pioneer Building pour une r\u00e9union soudaine et inqui\u00e9tante de tous les collaborateurs. Musk, assis sur un canap\u00e9 avec des dizaines d'employ\u00e9s d'OpenAI regroup\u00e9s autour de lui, l\u00e2cha la bombe en annon\u00e7ant qu'il quittait OpenAI pour de bon, expliquant que ses avanc\u00e9es dans l'IA chez Tesla avaient cr\u00e9\u00e9 un conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n\nSam Altman le remercia pour le temps qu'il avait pass\u00e9 dans l'entreprise et tenta de mettre fin \u00e0 la r\u00e9union de mani\u00e8re abrupte. Mais les employ\u00e9s voulaient des r\u00e9ponses, et Musk, \u00e9tant Musk, fit son show. Les questions fus\u00e8rent : \"Comment d\u00e9velopper cette technologie en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ? Pourquoi intensifier les efforts d'un concurrent chez Tesla si cela signifie intensifier une course \u00e0 la concurrence pour d\u00e9velopper l'IA qui pourrait devenir incontr\u00f4lable ?\" Finalement, Musk craqua et traita un jeune chercheur de \"cr\u00e9tin\", laissant les employ\u00e9s sous le choc.\n\n[...] M\u00eame si cela ne serait officialis\u00e9 qu'un an plus tard [en 2018], Sam Altman \u00e9tait d\u00e9sormais le PDG d'OpenAI. [Sam Altman sera licenci\u00e9 en novembre 2023 puis r\u00e9in\u00e9gr\u00e9 cinq jours plus tard apr\u00e8s que 700 des 770 employ\u00e9s d'OpenAI l'ait soutenu et aient menac\u00e9 de quitter l'entreprise. Un \u00e9pisode qualifi\u00e9 en interne de Blip]. \"\n\n\" Le mois m\u00eame o\u00f9 l'enqu\u00eate [li\u00e9e au licenciement d'Altman] innocentait Altman, Musk le poursuivit en justice, ainsi qu'OpenAI, affirmant que cette derni\u00e8re avait trahi sa mission \u00e0 but non lucratif. \"OpenAI a \u00e9t\u00e9 transform\u00e9e en une filiale de facto \u00e0 code source ferm\u00e9 de la plus grande entreprise technologique du monde : Microsoft\", peut-on lire dans la plainte initiale. \"Sous l'\u00e9gide de son nouveau conseil d'administration, elle ne se contente pas de d\u00e9velopper une IA, mais la perfectionne pour maximiser les profits de Microsoft, au lieu d'en faire profiter l'humanit\u00e9.\"\n\n\u00c0 D\u00e9couvrir Le Kangourou du jour R\u00e9pondre OpenAI a qualifi\u00e9 les plaintes de Musk de jalousie, estimant qu'il essayait de commercialiser l'IA avec sa propre entreprise. Mais la question \u00e9tait l\u00e9gitime : o\u00f9 \u00e9taient pass\u00e9s les quelque 50 millions de dollars que Musk avait donn\u00e9s \u00e0 OpenAI, une organisation \u00e0 but non lucratif qui en \u00e9tait \u00e0 ses d\u00e9buts ? S'\u00e9taient-ils volatilis\u00e9s ? N'avait-il rien re\u00e7u pour avoir financ\u00e9 ce mastodonte depuis le d\u00e9but ? Moins de deux semaines apr\u00e8s la victoire de Trump [aux \u00e9lections pr\u00e9sidentielles am\u00e9ricaines de 2024], Musk d\u00e9posa une version \u00e9largie de sa plainte contre Altman, OpenAI et Microsoft, qui reprenait essentiellement la critique de Geoffrey Hinton, le Prix Nobel de physique 2024 accusant Altman et OpenAI de plus se soucier de leur rentabilit\u00e9 que de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'IA.\n\nAu cas o\u00f9 quelqu'un se demanderait si c'\u00e9tait personnel, Musk d\u00e9clara au podcasteur Tucker Carlson dans une interview quelques semaines plus t\u00f4t : \"Je ne fais pas confiance \u00e0 OpenAI. Je ne fais pas confiance \u00e0 Sam Altman. Et je ne pense pas que nous devrions avoir l'IA la plus puissante du monde contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par quelqu'un qui n'est pas digne de confiance.\" OpenAI d\u00e9clara que le proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait aussi infond\u00e9 que les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, mais quelque chose \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent cette fois-ci : Altman [qui a, depuis, lanc\u00e9 le plan d'investissement StarGate avec le soutien de Donald Trump] \u00e9tait d\u00e9sormais l'ennemi le plus redoutable de l'homme qui avait l'oreille du pr\u00e9sident am\u00e9ricain. \""
